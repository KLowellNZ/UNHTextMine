1,on my way to work at 4am I noticed a bright white light travelling from the distance toward me over my neighbours house it passed over and stopped motionless and silent in the sky there were no normal red/green identification lights as per a plane or helicopter. the object made no sound. I took several pictures with my mobile phone and observed it for over 30 minutes not moving most fo the photos show just a bright white light however when I changed settings and looked at the pics I noticed that the shape had changed and that it was triangular with 5 distinct white lights along the perimeter any one know where I can post the pics as its really strange
2,I got my binoculars  it was like the top of a jellyfish on its side. i could see small lightning strikes all through it.red.green.blue.white. i have never seen such a thing. u know those electricity balls u get? It was that  just in the sky
3,I was sitting at the dinner table with my children  who did NOT witness this. I had a clear view out of my living room window from this vantage point  and saw what I assumed was a reflection of my saucer-shaped living room light fixture. I didn’t pay it much attention until I saw this ‘reflection’ increase in brightness.  It began to project beams of light to the ground  from its perimeter. After a few seconds  the beams retracted back into the craft and individual lights around the outside of it began to blink out in a circular pattern until nothing was left visible. At this point  I ran to the window and could see nothing. The craft was across the street from my house  to the left of a small storage shed at a playground.  There was nothing in this area that could have made any sort of light  much less a display like what I saw. I noticed that from where I was sitting  my living room light does not reflect in this window at all.. and even if it had  the craft was shaped like an upside down shallow bowl  and my light fixture is not turned in this manner.
4,One thing I totally remember is that it was hovering but not moving or wobbling around. It was standing perfectly still until the multi colored lights turned on. They were bright and awesome  then the white light came from it’s underbelly  that is when it began to lower its self straight down as if landing on something. I continued walking my dog as if nothing happened. Very strange to be so calm.  I may have been in slight shock….?but I’ll say this  I have always wanted to see one as I have been researching them since I was 17. Sometimes  you get what you wish for…be careful…
5,appeared extremely quickly and darted across the sky at twilight. Unable to follow because it was blocked behind a tree.
6,Initially moving in an erratic manner
7,Laying on top my bed talking to girlfriend.  Just gazing out the window at the only cloud I could see. Did not see anything going into the cloud but out comes to silver disc.  Called Airport and FBI.  No help or follow-up.
8,all happened to me and my friend Mike just this last weekend…… My friend and I were visiting with my mother and my uncle near Mena  Arkansas the weekend of October 16  2010. We were staying in a small camper on my uncles land  the door was facing the west where we had a good view of the tree line and the mountains in the beyond.  At about 2 a.m. we were watching through the camper window (looking out to the west) and noticed a small cluster of red  blue  and green lights. The object seemed to be just above the mountains in the distance. flying in a circular motion. After a few seconds it would seem to “jump” and begin flying in circles again.  My friend had gone to bed but i stayed up to watch the strange object. I pulled the curtain back on another window in the camper  and looked toward the mountains in the northwest and noticed several green lights flying a darting around above the tree line in different directions.  Jumping up i opened up the door to the cool night in order to get a better look at them. Then i woke my friend Mike and told him what i had seen off in the northwestern sky. He got up and came to the camper door and we watched as the numerous green lights flew around and at time hovered above the in the night sky above the mountains. A couple times the hovering lights would seem to almost “drip” what seemed like a green light.  Mike was exhausted and after watching the display for 5 or 10 minutes he went back to bed. I was fascinated too excited to think about anything but watching the lights in the sky. I went into my uncle’s house where i woke my mother and got my uncle’s binoculars. My mother and myself walked out toward the camper and using the binoculars i got a better look at the green lights/objects.  They were elongated hexagons and i could see lines that looked as if they formed some sort of panelling. My mother was sleepy  cold  and didn’t have her glasses with her. After a few minutes she went back inside the house  back to bed. I stood outside watching them through the binoculars until i got cold  then i went back inside the camper and kept watching them through the westward facing window for about another 2 hours.  Just before dawn i noticed yet another object in the sky that looked at first like a star  except that it was moving and was far too big to be a star. Looking at this third object through my uncle’s field glasses i saw a white rounded octagonal object. I woke Mike again. He looked at it through the binoculars  at first telling me it looked like a star he acknowledged at last that it was no star  handed the field glasses back and went back to sleep.  In the predawn twilight I studied the white object until it disappeared off to the west into the sky. By this time the green lights had also disappeared and the first rays of the sun had begun to appear in the east. With my head filled with thoughts of the things i saw that night i went to bed. I tried to sleep but instead lay there thinking until finally drifting off to sleep around 10 a.m.
9,it moved realy fast with no sound  no sonic boom  nothing.
10,I live on the Nautical Mile. Woke up around 4-4:30am for no reason. NO NOISE. EXTREMELY QUIET. Then bright white light lite the entire corner of the parking lot (2 buildings). Bed next to the window with blinds slightly up. I did not move  questioned light  but didn’t think anything of it. Then heard industrial sound 3 times.  Opened eye a little to peek and saw glowing yellow light at window. Thought workers outside. Noise stopped and then it started again. This time robotic sound at end of industrial sound. Realized this was UFO. Scared stiff as I laid in bed. Then light went out. Car drove by on Jefferson.
11,My roommate and i were traveling on 285 toward south cobb drive from perimeter mall. we were following these strange 4 orbs of blue lights in the sky  suddenly however  we were at our exit and we never remembered crossing over interstate 75 or getting to the exit.  we looked at each other in amazement wondering how we got to our exit in less then a minute on the clock. we got off the south cobb drive exit and headed towards perry blvd looking to head back into the city  when we suddenly saw the lights again over the west highland neighborhood off perry blvd.  We called a friend of ours to get his camera out and film it  but in a matter of less than 2 minutes the 4 blue orbs became one big bright white light and shot toward the city at an alarmingly fast rate. we lost sight of this light quickly  but looked south and it jogged left to right at a high rate of speed and then flew straight up in the air towards the city and disappeared.  traffic was very slow that night and we thought we were dead because there wasn’t any noise outside at all; however  when it left the night sky the city noises came right back.  very erie night for both of us. seemed like 5 minutes later we saw 2 f15s and several helicopters heading toward the city from the direction of Dobbins Air Force Base.we saw something  but what we don’t know. did seem like the airbase was in pursuit though.
12,I was  with my brother in-law driving down Vermont ave and i remember us making a left on Vernon. I don’t know what made me look up into the sky but when i did i saw this object just sitting there large in size.( I compared it to a very large Boeing 747. It had a lot of windows  and what i thought was strange was it seemed like fire was coming from it but it was like it wasn’t real.  It’s really hard to describe. also there were different colored lights on it; it would put you in the mind of Christmas lights. I remember asking my brother in-law if he saw what I saw and he thinks he saw it due to him driving.  Once i was dropped off back home  me and another friend who was in the car reflected on what we saw and we decide we should tell someone so we went across the street from my house at the time to our karate instructor and told him on what we saw. He told us to not tell anyone else because the U.S Army would take us away from our family so we didn’t or shall I say I didn’t. While we were telling him the story we seen the object again but it was in the distant and the color lights were showing and this time my instructor saw it and told us to go home.  I was 13 when that happen and i’m 45 now and it feels good to let that out because I know what i saw. Also I forgotten to mention  it looked like people were falling out or could it have been people going in i’m not sure me being in a moving car
13,There were lights hovering in the sky that appeared to be over Aptos or Santa Cruz. After watching it for a few minutes I went back in the house and got a pair of binoculars. The lights appeared to be circular and changed colors. I could hear a faint humming sound that did not sound like an aircraft of any sort.
14,We were on our way home to Cotton from Menahga and had just gone past Walker. This thing was coming toward us in the oncoming traffic  leading the parade  so to speak. Can’t tell if it was on the ground or just above the ground. I thought huge toy  right away  but it was going with the traffic at about 65 mph. My husband saw it too!  There were lots of cars behind it going in the same direction. I thought it must be some exhibit for the “Moon Days” celebration which is an annual event at Walker.   When I got home  I looked it up but Moon Days was over with. I don’t know what it was.  A toy wouldn’t have gone that fast. There were no glass windows  but around the black dome there were black indentations. I looked up UFO sightings and there was one very similar of a small  copper colored disk with a black dome seen on the ground in South Africa many years ago.  Have you heard of such a thing? Another strange thing that I didn’t see  but that my son did  was what appeared to be a huge  Boeing 707 hovering above the tree tops in Brainerd  Minnesota a couple years ago.  He and his family had seen it and he turned around and went back and parked the car to get a better look!  Nobody else paid any attention. Nobody else stopped to look at it.  It made no noise!  It appeared to be a huge balloon and it was close enough he could see the rivets! Has anybody heard of anything like this  before?
15,i was approx 15yrs of age  in a remote Pocono community in which my family had a vacation home (indian mt lakes)…i was hanging out with some older friends of mine about the month of august  between 9:30 and 11 pm when a football shaped object with a band of red flashing sequential lights appeared from below the tree line  above the lake and hovered silently above the tree line for at least 5 to 10min if not longer…there were 5 or 6 of us there and we were not the least anxious or afraid  but were just looking on with amazement…i  to this day cannot remember anything that happened after that  that evening..
16,I like to look at the stars and while walking my dog  I noticed this light. At first  I thought nothing of it and ignored it. while on youtube  I saw a UFO posting and thought it to be a coincidence  I told my husband about it  and we went to look at it  it was still there.  it was turning multiple colors  and had an aura it kind of looked like those static electricity orbs with the electricity flying out of the central color and went around the aura.. I went into my backyard to see if I could see it better  when I noticed another one. they were just there still  and changing colors. I tried to videotape it  and when I was  i noticed that they were going closer to each other  but very very slowly.  I was outside about 10 min when I decided to report it.
17,I was sitting on my porch and this is after my mother had a very interesting experience in her bedroom a few nights earlier…but thats a different story.  I saw what i thought was a star but i first saw it began to move then as it got closer i could hear a slight jet drone but the light got so close/big that i was actually seeing the craft not the light… it was badge shaped like a policeman’s badge kinda like the shield looking ones anyway it was banking a turn with the bottom of the craft facing me and then i could no longer see as the it was behind the tree in my front yard.  What makes it so strange is that my mother had been telling me that she had been seeing lights on the porch. and before this she had a rather strange encounter with a creature… i know it sounds crazy but my mother was terrified after her experience. I was terrified she told me to come in the room and it was dark she told me “there is something in here” i slowly turned the light on and i saw nothing she said she woke up and there was a grey figure beside her she tried to scream and she said she couldn’t scream or move. weird huh being all the lights and all.
18,Me and my mother’s friend were walking out from the house to her car to go to Hannaford  when I pointed to the sky in the west and saw a bright ball of light. I thought it was Mars  I was certain at first. “No  it’s a helicopter” she said. “No  it’s not. It’s a f***ing UFO” I said after studying it for a few seconds. I was terrified. So we were watching it  and I could see it hover up and down slightly  it wasn’t a planet. The red blinking  PURE RED lights from the radio tower in southern Newcastle on Route 1. The ball was a red/orange swirly orb. Then  just as it was there  it blanked out PITCH BLACK. Only night sky to be seen. But then she and I could see faint rings of  light blinking  in a circular form. I could see it moving back and forth in the sky  and then the other way by Damariscotta Lake. Keep in mind it was still far far away. On our way back from Hannaford we could see it moving toward the south  the whole while I was pleading for it to leave  and go away. I was terrified. I was shaking the whole time. This whole experience.
19,It was dark  and I saw three lights to the left of our car. I believe they were too large to be aircraft lights. As I watched they went out  one at a time.  A few moments later I saw them again for a few seconds before they went out again.  My husband also saw them the second time. The area is rather desolate  with no towers or farms in the immediate area.
20,@ 01:00 i spotted two lights coming over from the west. Both flying close to each other but the distance between them never changed. They seemed to be at a very low altitude level. There was no clouds to determine if they were below cloud level but it looked very likely. They moved towards me for a few in a perfect starlight line then began to move upwards. They ascended for a few seconds and stopped dead in their tracks. One blinked on and off for a few seconds and then they both vanished. there was no noise in the sky at the time just perfect silence. This is my fourth or fifth time seeing these objects in the last week after never seeing one before.
21,A airplane traveling southeast possibly a air canada around 5-7 pm was followed by a smaller cylindrical object near the plane  flying beside it going from the back to the front of one side a number of times then it made loops around the plane 2 to three times almost like sizing up the airplane.  The object the continued to go back an fourth along one side back an fourth a couple more times  and with a flash it defied all laws of physics without stopping travelled in the opposite direction for a couple of seconds and vanished
22,As we looked through the scope of a rifle hovering above the trees looking towards Mountain Home Air force Base.
23,i was taking pics of the storm rolling in i took a few quick shots… these photos were both taken at 12:30pm 7/19 i saw this in the second photo after i loaded my pics on the computer… I have no idea what it is or what it could be. We have seen strange lights at night in that area of the sky on quite a few occasions… neighbors have as well… at night the light is like a really bright pulsating star… that has almost like a glow around it i dont have a clue if its a UFO or not but i have no other explanation for it.
24,the object moved easterly across the north of Navan at exactly midnight at a height of about 500 mtrs  it was in view for about 2-3 minutes  it was a little over a half mile away from me in the sky so judging by its distance from me I would estimate that it was about the size of a van or a small truck but circular.  There was a very faint humming noise coming from it  other than that I didn’t notice anything. Some people have suggested that it was Chinese lanterns but I don’t believe that it was judging by the size and colour  maybe there’s another logical explanation as to what it was.  I definitely believe that it was a craft of some kind but the question that bugs me is from where?
25,First time was early May me and my wife to be was out in the yard working on flower beds. just got done and laid down in the yard . looked up and noticed silver craft moving in the sky.  told my wife to look up not knowing she was looking at a different one. they were heading at each other thats when we saw each others objects. There was a small cloud in sky this craft i seen first flew for the cloud going south very fast went by the cloud and then changed direction in a blink of a eye and went into cloud . watched the cloud until it faded away .  i never could see the object again. Until 10/08/2010 on a Friday after noon i was setting in the house . watching TV when a car was going down our gravel road very fast . wanted too see who it was looked and then thats when i noticed a silver object flying past up in the sky. It was the same shape color and size as the one in may .  only lasted maybe 20 seconds it stopped flew east twice . What i mean was it flew east out of sight and came back it did this twice then i noticed the second one for a couple of seconds then they shot off back east . ran out of house looked for awhile but never seen them again. I know what i looked at was nothing i have ever seen . this really upset me because the first time was like wow the second time was whats going on.
26,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPLBFxv72xs Turtle Back Zoo  West Orange  NJ – November 28  2010 -Video of several UFO’s above the Turtle Back Zoo in West Orange  New Jersey. Recorded 11-28-10 at 1721 hours in the parking lot. The objects are seen moving from the west to the east.  There is on object in the top right that moves in several directions at very fast speeds while the others stay in a pattern. This was a few days after thanksgiving and weeks before christmas. It is also within a few miles from New York City  where similar UFO’s have been seen in recent months.  There were several people in the parking lot and at the zoo  looking up in the sky  watching this. If you saw this or have another clip please tag this or send it to UFOatTBZ@gmail.com.
27,We saw orange lights that would appear for a few seconds then go out  another would show as it was going out farther down  then two would flash  then just one.. it was all along the ocean in different locations. They were not flares  or fireworks. I called the front desk and asked what they thought it could be and they said maybe ships shooting fireworks  but they were all orange  on and off like a flashlight.
28,There were around 20 yellow red orange lights moving in circles  and then they started formations of 3. After the formations  the lights disappeared into the dark sky.
29,I observed a brilliant green object emitting light. It changed intensity from bright to less bright approx 3 times as it was heading in a straight path south to north. This lasted approx. 4 seconds and then it went pitch black. The object had what looked like a green cloud around it. My best estimate was that it was traveling approx 600 to 700 mph.  I have spent half of my life dealing with aviation. I have seen thousands of aircraft in flight and certainly over 100 meteorites. This was neither. Too slow to be a meteor and definitely not navigational or strobe lights from a helicopter or airplane. It was maintaining a constant altitude and straight path. There was no sound. The green light was different than anything I had ever seen.
30,I was a child at the time and this object did not seem strange to me  I just thought it was another type of flying object like helicopters etc. I was just outside my house and I heard a buzzing sound which caused me to look up  above me at about the height of the house was a triangular shaped flying object which had approached from an easterly direction. It was triangular but the front point was rounded and the back had a series of cylinder shaped engine/exhaust type things. It was a silvery grey colour. I saw no lights. As I stood and stared at it  it stopped and hovered above me for about a minute  it then continued on towards the west. I didn’t think it strange or out of place at the time and so did not tell anyone about what I had seen  it was only a few years later when I had learned more about the world that I realised that what I had seen that day was not “normal”. I have told of this sighting a few times only to be laughed at more often than not  never taken seriously.
31,i was outside and saw red lights going up and down
32,I walked outside to let my dog out and I looked up and saw these lights  all the frogs and crickets stopped chirping and  I watched it come right over me! It was quiet   but I could hear a wind noise  it was going very slow. the neighbors dogs started barking at it. it went behind my house into the trees and I lost it. then like 5 minutes more or less it came back over.  the lights were round  but they looked like there were slits in the round part of the lights  all 3 of them  but it seemed to show more with the red lights I saw it the second time fly over Merlin  Rd. and and I could hear a couple of cars slow and stop as they had to have seen it as well! Then it was just gone?
33,I was getting off works and riding down the beltway on 495 and at the split from 495 and 95 going towards Northern Va or Baltimore there was atleast 12 floating glowing orange balls in the sky I tired to record a video in my phone but it was to dark
34,Orange orb moving across the sky  very bright  no tail. Seemed to be moving with a set direction  altitude  and speed. Appeared to be considerably lower in the sky than a commercial jet  maybe 1/2-2/3 of a jets altitude. It was moving fast but not at some incredible rate  I watched it across the sky for over a minute  possibly 2 minutes or slightly more. I had enough time to run back to the house and wake somebody up to see it for awhile just before it went out of sight.
35,At 12:04am. i went outside to have a smoke and just over the mountain i saw flickering lights that were red and white and possibly green? It must of been at least 10 miles or more away  im not sure. The flickering lights vanished at about 12:14am i think  it was not there long. VERY STRANGE!!!!!!!!!!
36,I was about nine years old  looking out a second floor window of my house in the middle of New Haven. It was broad daylight in the summer or spring. I looked past the chimney of the next house and saw an object in the distance. I’m afraid my memory is blurry. I wish I could say that I remember it clearly  but in fact I mostly remember looking out the window and then my descriptions of what I saw as I told my parents and others later. I drew a picture of it just after I saw it  but I don’t know what became of the picture. What I told others  and what I seem to remember  is that it was silver  had many small windows  much like a very large airplane  and did not really move for a little while. It hung there  in the distance  as I continued to see it past the chimney. It was not shaped like a plane. It was a disk. It was very long  and seemed larger and lower in the sky than any planes I had seen before in the area. It was far away  but I could see the windows clearly. It did not change in shape and did not really move. Of course everyone told me it was a plane  but I knew what a plane looks like  and I wasn’t THAT young. It was absolutely not a plane. Really it was a very mundane looking object  despite not being shaped like anything I had seen in the sky before. I’d like to believe it was just the government testing out some new military gizmo  but why the hell would they pick New Haven  or Connecticut  at all? I know what I saw  and though I wish someone would have believed little me  nothing anyone says will change that I saw it.
37,flying over my patio  & roof top of my home.  ufo was stable approximately 15 to 30 minutes with bright lights flashing.
38,UFO slowly zigzagged back and forth  up and down. At times it hovered perfectly still. When I first saw it the ufo was moving slowly towards the west. Then it came directly in my direction fairly close  hovered  then headed away from me northwest. I watched it for about 40-45 seconds before it winked out. The funny thing is my cat always wants to go out on the deck in the mornings to sun himself. I opened the door and he ran out  stopped on a dime  looked up at the sky and then ran back into the house with his ears back. I went out on the deck  looked up and saw the UFO almost above me.
39,Weird formation
40,First pass 10pm Second pass10:10 or so Third pass 10:20 Pretty neat
41,Possibly triangular in shape. Really wish I had had my telescope to take a closer look. Noticed it at first through my bedroom skylight but went outside to get a clear look at it and it was really moving around. Just enough that it couldn’t have been a star but not across the sky like a satellite.
42,Sitting out on the deck! I was able to see the beautiful moon through the trees before it disappeared. I was gazing up at the stars facing south when I noticed a bright object approaching.  I figured it was a jet but realized very quickly it wasn’t….to fast  no sound  no flashing red and blue lights that I usually hear and see. I stood up and watched it vanish. A jet soon came flying over….slower  flashing lights and a faint jet sound. Hmmmm.
43,For six months my team and I were mining near Bouse.  AZ. For five nights each week from M-F of each week between 8p and approximately 8:40p each night these orange/amber lights would appear just east of Abex Peak.  The lights would miraculously appear  separate into intricate formations and then occasionally recombine and dramatically have and then change positions. We have video of the anomalies as they become quite predictable over the weeks we observed them.  The lights were extraordinary and not easily explained by any of the group of 8 of us that observed them. I can be contacted by private email or here. We observed the Bouse lights over 15 times between November 2013 and February 2014
44,Ive seen one of these back home in pittsburgh  and that was 3 years ago. This is the first time ive seen once since. Its a triangle shape and its almost completely silent. For something to be that big and close and be silent is remarkable.  It flew over my head around 70th ave north and headed southeast along the shoreline. Then came to a stop almost and seemed like it started heading back inland (maybe around market commons  or air force base  hmmm)..  Didnt do everything i saw the last one back home do  but still remarkable.. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: B_lem006@yahoo.com
45,My friend and I were driving around in Howland one night on a back road that had nothing but trees and houses on it. There is nothing else anywhere around this area that could explain what we saw.  We noticed a circular object in the sky with some bright lights under it. The lights were red and white. At first we thought it was a plane  but those lights blink and planes travel in one direction.  The lights on this object weren’t blinking and the craft wasn’t moving. We drove a little further down this road because we thought we would eventually figure out what it was  but as we got closer to the object  we realized it farther above the trees than any kind of lights or anything like that and that it was lower than an airplane would be.  Also  it still wasn’t moving from its original position. My friend and I started to freak out a little bit and we turned around and drove the other way. I wish we had gone a little further  but when we figured out what we were looking at  or rather what it WASN’T  we got scared.  Now  I am a rationally 20 year old and I’m very down to earth (no pun intended)  but I really have no explanation for what I saw other than that it was a UFO. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: shebert257@yahoo.com
46,Was driving home from work approx. 11pm at nite on Hwy 8 west of Olympia and spotted what looked like at first a helicopter above the highway. I had thought at first maybe a search helicopter was out looking for someone.  My radio began not to work in my car so then my attention was this thing in front of me above the highway. It’s like it knew what I was thinking. There were a few other vehicles on the highway but it chose to follow me.  I noticed how round it was and it had bright lights all around it flashing. It was not a helicopter. It had then followed me a few more miles till I got home off the highway and by then I was scared.  I got out of my car and ran into the house and looked out the window and it was directly above my house. I tried to wake up my mother so someone else could confirm what I saw. But after a few minutes it had left.
47,Leaving my mother’s house in Mount Prospect IL tonight 4/11/11 at approximately 10:10 CST I saw a streaking light low in the southwest sky  moving east to west.  it was real fast definitely not a plane and low in the sky  anyone else see this. Bullet fast  gone in 5 seconds.
48,It glided silently over me and my mother i could see L shaped form of lights but not on. Right above the tree line.Very silent very large couldnt understand why anyone else didnt notice it besides me and my mother.
49,Lights would fade in and then fade out a few seconds later. Some would appear alone and some would appear in succession in a line. The spread of appearences was about 80 deg from left to right. There was no recognizable pattern.
50,My 23rd birthday I was late to my own party driving down from Williston but I went to JSC so I knew the area well enough. I was driving on 100 north in N Hyde Park driving to Eden..Belveder Mt rd.  I was just south of Ober Hill rd on the long straight stretch. It was a clear night probably half a moon when I saw it come out from on top of the tree tops on my right probably 600 or so yards ahead and 100 ft in the air moving into my path.  I became the most scared I have ever been and after watching it keep pace with me spacially. I blasted my radio and floored it and I dont remeber ever looking up to see where it was again..too scared.  I went back the next day to the area I saw to see if there was a school that mightve been shooting fireworks off but there was nothing there. A very desoulte stretch of road. A handful of houses  no schools no town offices nothing.  Gives me chills even to think of it now. I have been searching or years to see if anybody else reported anything that night If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: malickai4@yahoo.com
51,My husband and two and I wereoming home at about 9:30pm.  My husband one who would never believe such a thing was like the chiildren and me.  Mouths wide open.

53,Ufo Formation Flies in Mysterious Patterns
54,I notice something in the sky that was in the distant and i had never seen before and suddenly it turned around and came toward us. My grandma screamed to get inside and i was by now on the porch with her and my sister and friends still on the sidewalk.The silver object with its muiti-colored lights  just hovered over the telephone pole  just above it. We were all frozen with and unable to move and also curiost and it seemed like forever and then it just sped off so fast and disappeared to where i first noticed it.

55,The first was on 17 SEP 13. I went to have a smoke and from my balcony I saw in the distance six bright lights coming up the coast. they were in a tight group and I thought it might be a group of choppers but there was no sound.  The lead three distanced themselves from the rear three. Movemt was odd. erratic but precise as far as formation. Suddenly the first three made what appeared to be a ninety degree turn  accelerated and just vanished.  It was one of those WTF moments and I was having trouble believing what I just saw when the other three followed suit and were gone in seconds. Evidently there were others who witnessed them and reported as well. I know think it may have been two larger objects with three distinct lights because the distance between never varied in either group.  The second was tonight  29 OCT 13. Again  I went out after dinner for a smoke. The approach  for San Jose Airport runs pretty much right over my roof and there is always a line of planes coming in. I looked to my left and saw what I thought was a plane very low and heading directly towards my location.  My next thought was this didn’t make sense .I’d never seen a plane approach from that direction. After a few moments I realized it wasn’t moving at all. It was hovering in one spot  possibly with a slight swaying motion. It appeared as a bright white light edged with a multi- colored aura for lack of a better word. I watched it  puzzled  for about 15 minutes  looked at it with binoculars and tried to find landmarks to see if it was moving. Then  a friend happened to stop by. I showed him what I saw and his first comment was ” that things not moving. What the hell is that” We watched it for another ten minutes or so  then went inside thirty minutes later  we went out to have a smoke and check on the mystery light and it was gone. I even went to the other side of the building to see if  by some chance it was a bright Venus or something  whether it had moved with the rotation  but there was nothing . No trace anywhere around of an! orbiting object.  Just another head scratchier. know I am not a crackpot  delusional  hallucinating  or seeking attention. I am also unaware of any aircraft that can hover  with no movement or sound   and certainly not one that makes ninety degree turns an disappears so I believe it can be only one thing.  If anyone else in my area sees this and had a similar experience  please share. Thanks If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: dannyhum@yahoo.com
56,i have seen this “light” on several occasions and have been asking other people who say they have also seen it. the last time i saw it was 01-02-11 about 10:30pm.  It stayed in the sky for about 15 minutes total. On the morning of 01-03-11 there were 5000 blackbirds and over 100 000 fish that mysteriously died in Arkansas. I live only 7 miles from the Arkansas border.  I don’t know if the 2 are related but it seems like something pretty strange is going on.
57,This was an approximately 60 foot wide and tall sphere. It pulsated multiple colors and seemed to be spinning inside the object. Its been stationary for about a week now about a mile in the air. I have multiple videos from separate dates. Contact me to see them. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: texking69@live.com
58,traveling south on hwy 11 between Sperry and Skiatook okla.  My 2 yr old was with me and he saw it first.  Pulled over and watched it for about a minute and 1/2.  it was about sundown. the it just kind of shot off and disappeared.   When I told my husband what I saw he laughed at me and it made me start crying. I called channel 8 news and they said their phones were going crazy.  The air traffic controller at tulsa international said he could see it out the window but couldn’t pick it up on radar.  He said they were trying to brush it off as a metor but it was flying parallel to the ground .   Then I never heard another word but I have never forgotten that and would love to talk to someone else who saw it. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

59,It was very quiet you could hear a car crossing over the dam over the low hum of ufo. We would like to know who else saw it.
60,Another Mass sighting of Ufo’s in Los Angeles has Happened  and no im not talking about the giant light in the sky on Saturday I’m talking about a Fleet Of Ufos Witnessed Over Los Angeles. it was spotted on September 26th 2015 at 1pm Saturday for an L.A. Ufo Channel Event in Hollydale Park  Southgate California. We and the Public Gathered with a group of over 40 people as we have been doing for two years. We attempted a Meditation to Contact Ufo’s telepathically so we may witness them and present them to the public that joins us for free at our Meetups as well as present them to the world through the Media who helps present our findings.  Well this day when we meditated someone in the maditation during their telepathic contact attempts asked for a Fleet/ Ufo Formation  and you wouldn’t believe this unless you were there but right after the meditation session was over literally just minutes after Danny from the group saw and notified the rest of us to know where to look so we could see it as well.  what we saw were these set of objects Coming out of a Chemtrail haze opening in the sky  this beauty of a Sighting was 12 gorgeous strange riveting Paranormal Orbs that flew out of the cham haze opening and then continued in front of it decending in beautiful patterns and formations.   You can hear in the footage that everyone else in the group of over 30 of us that gathered that day soon starts to see the objects and react to the sighting with the amazement and surprise of this intelligent group of objects as they traveled out if a Chem trail and flew in intelligent displays of their ability to interact  ways we know our best Jet fighters can’t event do. I filmed it with my Canon T3i at 600 times zoom  witch is because of a 300 times canon scope attached to a double amplifying Barr to get as closest I could and film the clearest shot of this Anomalies witnessed that day over the skies of Los Angeles. If you would like to see what we witnessed you can find the Footage here  -Best regards Fausto Perez Co-Founder of the research orginization L.A.

61,I was sighting at the park attemting to contact ufo’s when a highschool cross country team stopped by as soon as I witnessed the first ufo resulting in them freaking out over witnessing the Ufo I was Filming  -Best regards Fausto Perez Co-Founder of the research orginization L.A.

62,I had woken to use the restroom and decided I wanted to go outside for a cigarette. While standing on the back porch  I noticed a very bright light that I thought was a star a first. Then  I realized it was too bright and too close to be a star. I thought maybe it could be an airplane or helicopter but there were no other lights nor was there any sound.  I recorded it on my cell phone. During the recording  you can hear the neighbor’s dog howl twice but no sounds of helicopters or airplanes. I don’t know what I saw  but I know it wasn’t the normal day to day aircraft we see. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: shaideemrw@gmail.com
63,Sitting in hot tub with my wife  late afternoon  looking out over Breton Bay and Potomac river  when two cigar shaped multi colored objects just appear in sky. Stayed several minutes then suddenly  a puff of smoke appears and they were gone.  Objects hovered and also zig zagged in sky over the area. Most interesting  is that next day  at least 5-10 navy helicopters hovered over the area and the Potomac river for hours. Large naval base nearby  Pax River Naval station.  I asked around the next day and nobody I knew had seen it. I was a member of the Sheriff’s department and they also did not know anything about it. I assumed it was a secret weapons test but like nothing I have ever seen. Was over a populated area  not over the base.
64,Have video for two days in a row same ufo same time same location went chasing each time used compass to figure out location will most Likely show up again
65,Stormy night. Could only see object during lighting flashes. No noise  no lights. Appeared to have exterior texture of piping and panels. Not nearly as elaborate as a “Borg” ship. More like 1-3 railroad boxcars. Like multiple objects of same sized attached together moving as one unit. Very large and seemed to take up the space of a boxcar if I was 5 feet away. The scale was difficult to make out as I was not sure how high above the power lines this object was. Slow and steady movement. Object continued to move in same direction until no longer visible in the rain/low clouds. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: emc2jc@yahoo.com
66,My wife (who hates sci fi stuff) brought to my attn a cyl shaped object traveling very very slowly over the distant fields. Best guess conroy (place where the silo exploded) shares same rd with tanager mall. This happened about 8 yrs back in april. it was NOT a plane  or blimp..cylinder shape very prominent. clear sky a few clouds. by the time we got to where it would have been I did not see it. we were on rt 6. I have traveled that road hundreds of times.
67,Me  my father and brothers were going outside on New Years Eve  because my father fired his pistol off at midnight every year and my brothers and I lit fireworks. It was then we saw the (saucer) as it came in our direction and passed directly over the house. It had an outer ring of white lights (edge of disc underneath) and two rows of ring shaped lights on the bottom center of the disc   each ring revolving in opposite directions of each other. The outer ring was white and the inner ring was a series of red and blue lights. I had told my father to shoot at it and he replied  NO! it might shoot back with something bigger. It made no sound and appeared to be revolving very slowly. It was also traveling very slowly for quite awhile until we lost sight of it. We then went inside and he called McQuire AFB to report it. We lived in the flight path of the base and also have seen the aircraft on the base  on the ground and in the air. But this was something weve never seen before.
68,Fairly bright orange objects would appear and then disappear. The first one seemed to be moving in a northerly direction. It vanished. Shortly thereafter  two more lights appeared. They seemed to be moving in a southerly direction.  The lights vanished. They could have been some sort of Chinese lanterns. They seemed to be higher  brighter and larger than traditional lanterns. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: Mdchappell@comcast.net
69,I was awake just before dawn. The sky was dark  but lightening. I saw a silver disk-shaped object  moving very quickly  at a downward angle–not straight down. It was way faster than an airplane and there was no sound. The rising sun must have caught it just right. It was shiny and silver.
70,As me and my girlfriend were leaving Bayside in Downtown Miami I looked to the Northwestern sky and noticed a white light traveling very fast and I told my girlfriend thinking it was a drone but the light was not blinking as drones usually have flashing lights and than it went from NW to Southeast suddenly for a few seconds and than went in the NW direction and the white light suddenly disappeared.
71,In 1969 the police and vacationers at Lanes end  Melvin village NH    Saw many space craft  and the day after my sister and brother experienced a ship above Melvin Bay on Lake Winnippasoccie     I saw 4 foot hieght alliens looking around on camp grounds 3:30 AM for something my mother was terrified I was excited and courious     This is all hidden from media   Why?   the owners of Lanes end will verify my findings to the T in fact we communicate till this Day I am 57 Old and hoest    please Talk  781-462-8363 If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

72,my husband told me this story. he wont talk about it because he feels people will laugh at him. but he had a witness. and it gave him goose bumps. anyway  it was blimp shaped  and moved very slowly. he was on route 7 going north from pownal. he was on the 3 lane when he noticed the object. he pulled over to watch it. the lights were white and located on the bottom. as the lights went from his left to right and around  it would get dark on one side and then light back up when the light came back around. it moved southeast toward massachusetts. he is wondering if anyone else saw this object. it was seen in the fall of 1985-thru-fall 1987. he cant remember the year exactly but was late 80’s. if you seen this object  please share. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: kmm200979@yahoo.com
73,Flying sauce was hovering next to windows of the House # 47 up on third floor right side  next to mechanic parking lot.
74,1 a.m. in the morning I woke up and looked out the window and  looked up and noticed something out of place…the ufo was triangle in shape and very bright…it would dart from one point to another at high speeds..as I know a comet could never do this type of movement.   Woke my girlfriend up and she witnessed it as well it can’t be explained. it was up there for a couple of hours just hovering. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: stoefflertroy@gmail.com
75,Stared at two then disappeared. And then five flew over and stopped.
76,ufo was hovering in woods for about 15minutes then rose up in sky and took off was triangular with red lights around outside of craft and some white lights
77,My family was out in the yard of this old farmhouse when we saw the object. They would sit in one spot for several minutes then they would move faster than a blink of an eye and scatter to different areas and sit. Then they were gone as quick as they came.  They where silent and as close as they were we never heard a sound from them. If anyone else saw this please contact me. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: pardiville@yahoo.com
78,They were traveling across the sky in an irregular flight path but generally SSE. I would say they were 1/2mile apart during flight. They were extremly bright  traveling lower and faster than a plane or satelite. I used to be a professional weather man in the USAF. I have never witnessed any thing like these objects.
79,this object which I thought to be the space station or satelite was initialy going straight across the eastern sky started to turn nw and then started to turn westerly and finally turned south and picked up incredible speed and then turned se and disappeared behind trees in next yard over  needless to say I had goose bumps
80,I  noticed  what  apeared  to be  three  twinkling  stars  last  night  about  1am  as  I took my  trash  out  so  I  gazed  at  thes  for  a minute  and noticed  they  wernt  stars  they  fell  and  ascended and  descended again moving highly  unusually  for anything  other  then  ufos this  wass  the  24th  well  its  now  he  25th  and  the  same  objects  are  back  and  in  just  aslightly  different  setting  since  last  night but  ther  are  now  atleast  five  visible  objects some  flasjing  diff colors  some  just  a solid  color but  I  do  know  what IM  looking at  NO DOUBT  if  this  continues  evrynight  IV  got  to  get  somebody  out  here  to  report  this  to  and try  and  get it  on  film   you  would  have  to  see it to believe  it  IM  not  the  only witness to this  either If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

81,I was building a deck on a house next to the Mott’s Creek Inn. I had stopped working for 10 minutes or so to take a break when i noticed something strange way up in the sky near the old nuclear plant in Oyster Creek which is located across the water from Mott’s Creek  where i was.   What caught my attention was that i thought it had disappeared from sight  then reappeared farther away. I watched it for about 20 seconds when i realized this defiantly was not a plane. I grabbed my phone to take a picture when it disappeared again.  It then reappeared in a different location  which is when i snapped the first picture.  It zig-zagged like nothing i have ever seen before. I did not know of anything that could travel at such a high rate of speed  zig-zag and disappear from sight on such a clear day. I managed to get one more photo before it shot straight up and out of sight in a fraction of a second. On my last day at the job  I saw a similar object as before except this one was much larger and closer.  I heard no noise on either day nor was there any other object  (plane  helicopter) around. The second object moved up  down  side to side  very fast. It almost seemed to be like skipping around  like it was jumping from place to place. it wasn’t like it was flying. It was like a glitching jump to the next position in the sky.   I have absolutely no doubt that what i saw was not from here. I got a very weird feeling when i saw both of them  like i was watching something that i should only be seeing in a movie. I have three total pictures from both days. I have two pictures of the object i saw on December 30th and one picture from January 12th. If you are interested in seeing them  contact me. I would like to know what i saw.
82,A bright white-yellow light moving slightly slower than the speed of a satellite. The distance is hard to estimate  possibly higher than an airplane.  It made no sound. Mostly traveling in a straight line towards east  though what caught our attention was a “zic zac” pattern it did twice on its journey before getting behind the treeline and could no longer be seen.
83,First off I would like to mention that on the morning of Jan 20th  I reported this incident to MUFON while it was fresh Mufon accepted and my room mate and I found it posted on some Calif.based sight. Mufon didn’t allow me enough room to finish sighting which to my dismay seems rather taking incidences and only sensationalizing.  I to tried to contact ieMary the Mufon investigator in Hawaii but her sight is dead also.I know what I saw because it was so close and my room mate as well. Also the fact that now for three nights since have we been witnessing this same ships activity.I just wish to say that when an individual experiences such the contact is quite dramatic emotionally I felt networks like MUFON actually helped connect these issues.  I will add to that the first events sighting was Billy Myers close…Thanks at least I got this reported
84,I walked outside of a friends house to smoke a cigarette. I was looking up at the stars  thinking how clear it was and how bright the stars were. As I looked  a very low cloud went by with multi colored lights flashing behind it.  What’s weird is that as the thing was going across the sky  it was like it wouldn’t compute in my head. It wasn’t until it was long gone that I realized what I had seen. I’ve only told a few close friends and this is the only time I’ll report it.
85,definitely not a human aircraft… the strangest thing i have ever seen so far
86,10 pm. dark. cloudless sky. I was driving up a steep hill  approaching a stop sign. when i stopped i was looking up at the starry sky. i noticed a T shaped object moving very slowly across the sky.  the only reason i saw it was because as it moved it blocked out the stars. it had no lights. it was huge and moved to slow to be a plane. then it moved out of view behind a bluff.
87,IT WAS FLYIN LIKE A PLANE THEN STOPPED MID AIR STARTED GLOWING ORANGE LIKE IF WERE ON FIRE.5SECONDS OF ORANGE LIGHT AND THEN SHOT OFF AT EXCELLERATED SPEEDS CHANGING DIRECTIONS CONSTANTLY. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: MITCHIEPOOH.POKERFREAK@HOTMAIL.COM
88,I was golfing Oct3 at Glacier Golf Course Macomb Twp..I was teeing my golf ball up and I looked up and saw a cloud  (mostly sunny day)and all if a sudden 2 objects came out  going in different directions..How can that be  no trace of any jets going into cloud but 2 coming out GOING IN DIFFRENT DIRECTIONS very strange  !!!
89,Sitting in the backyard around the fire pit I saw three very fast moving objects all within ten min of each other there were no flashing lights they did not zig zag but did move unusually fast across the sky they were not shooting stars but more like a really high altitude object going somewhere I don’t know but I just wanna know if anyone else saw the objects I feel crazy to be honest
90,iwas taking my dog out that evening for her nitely walk in the and i noticed she was looking up toward the north. i looked up to see what it was that she saw..this brilliant white lite was moving from north to south at a good clip.  i watched it till it was out of site….then two nites later around the same time the same lite appeared but going west to east about the same speed there was no sound  it did not pulse  it did change colors  it flew straight with no waver. i truly believe that it was a ufo 
91,This craft was seen in the vicinity of United Nuclear Reprocessing plant where there had been a “leak”  at least 1 death resulting that was verified. Many  many sightings were reported over a span of several weeks.  United Nuclear had its location in the coldest spot of RI  near a spot called Wood River that led to a massive underground waterway  and they had many  many 6-8 foot deep trenches  at least 10 feet wide that could be flooded with their “waste” water  filtered through very deep sandy subsoil and cooled by the deep waters that flowed from Wood River  just north of Rt.91  commonly called the Carolina Alton Rd. I am not crazy. I saw this craft. It made no sound as it slowly moved about 20 feet above the tree tops. All I heard was the displacement of the wind  like a soft breeze.

92,Was delivery driver for company that made runs from New Jersey to Philadelphia and delaware in one night. Approaching last part of run and was with co-worker as the highway dipped down and a large hill approached. I had seen a bright light high above trees and from bottom of hill it seemed an odd vantage point for a street light being above trees and in middle of nowhere.  As we approached top of hill the light remained still and we pulled to the the opposite side of the road which had to be maybe 4 car lenghts at least.  We both got out to get a better look at this light that hovered motionless like a still in a picture frame but reminded me of the spotlight on like a search helicopter or like helicopters in movies. This was late at night about 2 am and no traffic and even being just across the highway no noise could be heard. And as if this light was disturbed or had gotten orders to move it smoothly accelerated away from above the trees and out into the distance while circling us as to observe us and then finally crossing over to our side of the highway and proceeded straight in the direction we were going until we couldn’t see anymore.  The absence of noise and the smooth velocity and the way it just didn’t fly off but kind of circled us has always been my unexplained moment that I have shared with family and some friends. Found this site with other delaware sightings and was intrigued to share.
93,For a brief moment i saw it turn no lights on the back side it was huge blackened steel block shape in the sky it was at an angle so no way to tell exact shape while it banked to the north at low elevation
94,I was driving home from Cromwell heading south. It was a clear night. When I got on 91s I came around a bend and saw the bright light. I thought it was a plane  but thought it look a little low.  As I travel the odd thing was as I got closer the light got bigger  but the object didn’t appear to be moving. It then became evident it wasn’t moving and there were actually three light on the front. The one in the middle was much larger than the two side ones.  There was also 3 circle white light with a red and blue light inside it circling around. It was HUGE and what was unsettling was it was completely SILENT!!! At one point I was directly across the highway from it and could see underneath. Very eerie and unsettling.
95,Driving South on Hwy 101 this morning. I saw a very bright disc shaped object in the sky appeared to be hovering somewhere over the bay. Image lasted about a minute  then simply disappeared. It reappeared about a minute later but only laster about 30 seconds and them blinked out.
96,!Seen  on 2  different  nights by 2 separate  people not together.
97,One large bright light. At least 4-5 smaller bright light close to it. There was two separate small lights we watch break off the larger light. One went to the south and then the other broke off and went to the north. They were moving about 10 times quicker than the jets.   Some of the smaller light that were around the bigger light move as well  but still stay close. The big light did not move. It was around 4-5am. I was upset to be woke up earlier than I had to be to start the turkey.
98,Looking at sky for Moon(Jan. 2014 has 2 full moons)  I noticed 2 bands of rotating orange lights moving slowly towards me. 1st thought 2 aircraft in wing formation. But they slowly moved to one on top of other and both then slowly moving straight up. I then noticed a 3rd one moving from same direction as 1st two  (I called for my 2 friends in doors to come see  I was on front deck of beach house). As they joined me on deck  then too saw all 3 craft.  As we stood watching  the 3rd craft aligned under 1st two and it slowly moved up too.  Then we all saw the 1st craft(seemly not very high  maybe 1000ft(a guess) slowly disappear.  As moving up  it seemed to go behind  or into the night sky. Like something moving behind a curtain.   That’s when we all noticed the 4th craft coming from same direction as others to now join them in same up position. We all noticed there was no sound.  Even the ocean was clam. No loud surf crashing.  We watch until all 4 crafts moved up where 1st had gone and simply seemed to vanish.  About 15 mins we watched. None of us have ever seen these craft before. The craft moved slowly  no sudden moves  except flying slightly upward to a point where they moved straight up.
99,I was outside in my backyard on December 31 2013 approximately 9:53-10pm with my dog saw a red light with no running lights/ hazard blinking lights just a steady red one.  No noise  a plane had passed in the west a few minutes earlier and was clear as a bell to hear it and understand where it was looked to be over Nepean western Ottawa. The red light travel at about half the speed of the commercial plane came in a southern direction.  I was able to see it through a tree in my neighbors yard (winter no foliage) when it cleared the tree I was able to get an un obstructed view of it and noticed there was a second red light that was keeping pace with the first. Again it had no blinking lights just a steady red no pulsing more like a light bulb almost and no noise.  It was a clear cold night  a little dampness in the air which can often make jet engines sound louder or throatier.   I watched the lights travel for about 5-7 mins they both came from what looked to be over the Gatineau hills in a southern direction   they both turned/ banked and started to head more south easterly where they again turned north easterly and to a high elevation in the sky.   Then they seemed to fade out I wasn’t able to see them anymore the sky was clear cloud coverage was minimal    The second light followed the same path as the first and faded out lost visual contact with at about the same spot in the sky the lights were about 15-20 seconds apart but clearly followed the same path. As the first light faded out and the second was approaching the firsts spot of lost contact I was able to see 2 planes traveling north west in the western sky   both clearly marked commercial planes with blinking running/ hazard lights.  the UFO I saw was just a red light in the sky nothing else was seen blinking or anything to make me assume it was a commercial flight.
100,It was sunset.   I even took a picture of the sunset with my phone.  Next to the sunset was a shadow circle/ globe in the picture.  But  couldn’t see the circle while looking at the sunset.    Then suddenly I saw this triangular looking ball of flame shooting straight into the sky.   Something like a firework  flare gun?????  But  it kept going higher and higher past the clouds and did not burn out!?  UFO?!   I dunno.   Never seen anything like that before?!
101,coming from waterbury 6:45 pm I 691. Thought it was a comet at first due to the green light. As i a got closer to the object  i realized it had a cigar shape to it. Light was on the front of the object. Drove to the small airport in 15 minutes. No traffic and looked closed. Freaked me out. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

102,it had big lights thats all i know If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: groovydoodz070502@hotmail
103,I was talking on the phone with my aunt when I saw a slowly moving object in the sky. It wasn’t that high but it was a long distance between me and the object. It was in shape of triangle.  What really considered me was that the ufo turned on 3 lights that were in a line. They were bright big and white. It than turned them off after about 10 seconds and slowly flew away than disappeared. It was in the evening so I couldn’t see all the details.
104,idk  but figure I would send this  at first I thought someone lost their balloon in the parking lot and it was floating away  until I realized it was too big for the distance I was (starbucks parking lot)  I think… I saw this thing at first it caught my eye because it seemed to tilt back and forth(like a balloon floating and being tweaked by wind) but it wasnt floating up  but straight across and at a constant speed  it only tilted few times before stabilizing  just a dark fat disk looking(again like one of those mylar balloons  floating on its side) 
105,I’m really not sure of date. It was my grandparents anniversary  I think 169/1970. My whole famiy was there for a party in the side yard which was very big. My cousin and I were sitting on the steps of the patio and we were observing an object in the sky. My cousin and I were always into UFO’s. We belonged to National Investigation committee of aerial Phenomena. We started making phone calls to people to see if there are seeing the same thing we are. We were getting good response back on this. We called a friend at Wright Patterson air force base and he said they were monitoring it. He said there were sending fighter jets out to investigate it. Short time after the jets flew over breaking the sound barrier and when they approached it that’s when it started to move and it moved towards the sun  like a good military move to blind the pursuing planes.  We watched this for about a minute then my mother screamed and we all turned around and there it was. A dream come true. A mother ship just sitting there about one hundred feet up. Just above the tree tops. No sound and no movement. You could see excellent detail. It was like looking at a star wars ship. Loved it.  a minute later it took off. Here then gone in a split second.

106,We were driving south on Rt 23 in Wantage.  Saw small groupings of orange lights  At first they seemed to be hovering or stopped then they seemed to be in a formation of triangles and traveling closely at the same rate of speed. We rolled down car window and heard no noise.  Not helicopters.   A neighbor  a block away from this site saw them from her window in her house at the same time and described the same phenomenon. Much brighter than planes. Another car was stopped at the side of the road watching also.
107,
108,stoped over tree line.had contact at leasted the one I spoke with under stood english asked if I wanted to go with them.I choose to stay.human looking but not and there maybe a dangerouse element for some people in going with them like death sorry but that what I gathered from the conversation. they are peaceful as far as I can see Mind communication is how we conversed.We may have been taken abourd some unacounted time hade past.they can move at great speeds unhumanly and maybe or have something to due with africa or eygipt and isrial bible related possibly spiritual in some ways. you have my email leave number and I will call you if further interested.thank you john.

109,I was coming home from grabbing a bite to eat  and saw the orange orb in the sky.  I pulled over to watch to see if it would move  and turned off my car.  It began to move  directly towards my car  slowly  and out of fear  I started the car  and went towards my home slowly.   I watched it as I drove and saw it drop a bright orange liquid from itself  looking to be some type of molten hot liquid.  I then saw two neighbors out changing a flat tire  and told them to run to the corner to see it and try to get it on their cell phone vid  which they did.   The female neighbor caught it on the cell phone  and caught the object dropping more molten liquid  which burned itself out in the air as it dropped towards the ground.  It seemed to actually shoot it downward towards the ground.   After she got it on vid for about 2 minutes  it blinked out.  It showed up just a few minutes later (assuming it was the same one) about ten miles away  seemingly  somewhere over the countryside of the Sebastopol  Ca area.   It just sat hovering  without movement  but was quite large and very low in the horizon.  I could no longer see it through the trees in front of my house  but went down the street to watch it for about five minutes more  but it just sat and did not move.  I witnessed this with other neighbors.   They stayed and continued watching  I went inside.  This is not the first sighting I have experienced.  It is the second one within a two year period  both witnessed by other people.   The first experience was in Windsor  Ca  witnessed by at least 12 others outside of a restaurant.  Both sightings involved red/orange orbs.  The first sighting was three orbs  the second  tonight  was one orb.
110,I been thinking about this a lot and it’s been bothering me. As I was leaving the county fair  I seen a bright white orb flying south to north over hwy 101. It flew 100 yards slow enough to see it then it just sort of just hit the gas and was gone so fast  as soon as I yeld for others with me to look  it was gone. No one seen it  but I did and I’m convinced it was a UFO! Or something! If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: Ljeezybaby@gmail.com
111,at first seen an orb off in the distance going back and forth three miles north of me. I live on top of a hill on an island 100 feet above sea level. as it got within 1 mile the orb was making a giant circle 1/3 mile dia. at 3 miles it looked like it was going back and forth.  then all of a sudden in side the center of the circle a giant ball of light appeared 300 to 400 feet dia. with a huge orange ring around the ball that was 800 to 1000 feet dia. it looked liked Saturn on its side. there was a hazy foggy thing happening around center ball of light the ring looked like it was segmented like an orange and the orb just kept going around everything 4 seconds to 1 rev. counter clock wise.  this all happened the center activity in 15 to 20 seconds then the center went out. but orb kept going around the center was invisible. then it got a little higher in elevation and continued south south east right over my head. when the center was lit up large ring was facing north. this is one of dozens of object I see half dozen a year.  most of the time they come out of north west sky moving slow. it seems they use the light houses as navigation. genially they are less than 1000 feet up. 40 to 50 mph. almost never any noise. I know this area well I have topo’s and charts I fish here and hunt here for 27 years I dig clams right were this thing hovered. biggest ufo yet!

112,i saw this light int he sky that was pretty small so i assumed it was a star  but as i watched it it started going higher and then it started moving to the left and went behind some trees and then it was gone.
113,I saw the light  at first I thought it was a plane  until I realized it was not moving. I was at a stop light when I saw smaller objects circling the bright light object  that’s when I started really paying attention. I watched these objects for a few moment until I got home and told my husband.  We both ran in the car and drove until we were able to get a better view of these objects. Which we end up on James Island on a boat landing. That’s where we saw it better and the smaller objects were all over the place. My husband at first was like no way this real  until he saw the reflection of the big light on the water.  I wish we had stayed  we were in such a rush to get closer  so we traveled to Folly Beach and saw nothing  so we drove back to the boat landing and it was gone. So  now every night I am staring into the sky.  I have always believed in UFO’s and will always be interested. Some people just have a fear of the unknown or just feel that we are the only beings. Had my camera on my phone  but did not think about taking photos. I should have.
114,My son and I were driving north on the Southfield Fwy and we noticed a particularly bright ‘star’ in the sky to our left.  We immediately said “look – what is that??” because we know enough to know that a star would not appear to be that close.  It seemed to be closer than the average-size passenger airplane flying overhead around the same time. We stared at it for a couple of seconds.  My son was driving  so he looked away and I kept watching it.  That is when it took off going forward.  I saw it when it first began to move.  I caught a glimpse of its shape.  It wasn’t as bright – as ‘star’ like – and I saw the ball-shape with the spikes at the top and bottom.  It was luminous but not bright as a ‘star.’  In the blink of an eye  it had moved so far away that it looked like a little twinkle.  I said to my son “did you see that?!” and he said “yeah – I saw it!” In another blink of an eye it was a white dot in the sky that had made a ‘hard right’ and was ascending full speed ahead across the sky.  It was moving so fast I could see what looked like wind-streaks on its side and behind it.  My son said “look at it flying across the sky!” I believe I saw it again in the same spot a couple of nights later but it was further away this time and did not move.  I think I know it when I see it now because it has an elongated shape – not the usual round twinkle of a real star – and it is still the brightest ‘star’ in the sky. I told my parents about it a few days later and they told me there were reports of a meteor shower in the news.  That was no meteor.
115,There was no sound..
116,While sitting on my deck overlooking Rock Haven Lake in West Newfield Maine  looking at the night sky as I often do  I noticed a peculiar-looking white object brighter than a star on fouro consecutive nights in a row.  The airplane incident occurred only on the night of September 19  2013…on the other three nights the object was just stationery –  sitting there for hours.  It was not in the same position any of the four nights.  Sometimes higher  sometimes lower.  the full moon lit up the sky brilliantly and it was a very clear night. Would appreciate hearing from others so that I know I’m not going crazy!!! If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: sheak@gmail.com
117,Last night at around 9 PM I was standing outside when I noticed a particularly bright star southeast in the sky where I hadn’t seen any like that before.   It was a little hard to see because we live in the woods and it was visible through the tree line  so I went up into our garden above the house to get a better look.   There was no wind and yet it seemed the trees moved or else it was the light.  As I stood there it moved very slowly  so that at first I wasn’t sure if it was moving or I wasn’t seeing right.   After about ten minutes my husband came out to watch and agreed that it was moving and he joined me  watching the very slow progress across the sky.  It stopped every once in a while and hung there  then moved ever so slowly again.   While it was hanging I saw a couple of what looked like the lights of a small plane.  I thought that they must be able to see this if I can see it on the ground.   They kept on their path and this happened 3 times  which is an unusual amount of air traffic for our area.  It moved so slowly and also seemed to wobble a little several times.  Then it stayed in the same spot for a long time and we went inside to rest our necks.   I went out to check every 20 minutes or so and it was in about the same place.  I fell asleep on the couch and woke up at 12:35 AM and went outside to look.  At this point it had moved a little to the West and had apparently climbed in altitude.   It looked smaller  but was still the very bright set of lights that we had seen earlier.  I called my daughter at one point asking her to see if there was anything on the internet about this  other than that we didn’t notify anyone.   I couldn’t imagine that at 9PM on a Sunday night that someone else hadn’t seen it.  I looked again at 3AM and there was some cloud cover and no sign of lights.
118,About 40 degrees about southern horizon. Moved slowly from west to east  and almost seemed to ‘stop and turn’. (Don’t know any other way to describe.) After a few minutes  it rose into the cloud cover. The size of the ball was huge. Stunning. Occured at appx 11pm.
119,on a typical friday night at about 8:30 pm  i got out of my car after a run to the store and noticed something in the corner of my eye  at first i thought it was a firework or flare  maybe shot off at the lions club   but it hung their and kind of wabbled slowley in multiple drections like a helicoptor. what i saw was clear as day! however there were no blinking lights and no sound.   after a little over a minute it took off in a straight line towards coventry  as it left it didnt appear to descend at all and i could tell it was an object by how it looked in front of and behind sparse clouds in the sky.  i took a video with my phone but all it shows is pitch black and a porch light about 100ft in front of me.
120,Sitting on back deck  looking east and notice 2 then 4 orange fire balls in the sky. First thought of airplane  but within minute at least 10+ more were there forming patterns like a triangle with an extra one in the point of triangle. It seemed as if there were 4or 5 groupings of triangle formations. The objects just hovered back and forth almost looked like they were not moving at all. After 5 mins or so headed north west in a sideways type of movement. 4 of us witnesses this truly unexplainable.
121,I  my wife and my father were on the Springmaid Fishing Pier on Sept 19  2009 at @8:45.  The weather was slightly hazy  the surf was extremely rough and there was a strong steady wind. I was facing north looking up the coast toward downtown Myrtle Beach. I noticed a sudden large beam of light coming from a stationary object that was offshore.  The beam lasted approximately 45 seconds and then slowly faded out.   The Spring Maid Pier is across the highway from the airport. There were no other aircraft in the air at the time of this sighting. I have fished on the Spring Maid Pier many times at night and have seen aircraft coming and going from many different directions  I have never seen anything like this before.
122,They (3 objects) were very quiet and hovering counter clockwise in the Northeast direction. An Adams county sherrif also spotted them and put his spotlight on the objects but the spotlight was burned out by the objects. This information was in the Thornton/Northglenn Sentinal back in October of 1973 but I can’t find the article anywhere. Can somebody find this article somehow?

123,3 minors very trustworthy called on cell phone completely freaked out with an identicle story only varying a little on the description.
124,I work graveyard shift at the brooklyn union pacific railroad yard around 12:30 am i noticed a red and green light moving sideways up and down at great speeds.there was no noise it stayed still  then would move again.it  disapered  then appear  again If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

125,I was walking up to my house and stopped to look up at the stars and then I noticed this one star started to move and it was waaaaay to high for a plane it looked like a dot like the stars but it was moving left in the sky and was moving pretty fast but I was just watching it and then as it got closer to another star that star to started to move right behind it and the moved about ten more inches to the left and just vanished! It completely freaked me out If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: Mikey1019@gmail.com
126,These orange glowing orbs traveled from south east to northwest at an approximate distance between them of two hundred feet apart in  a straight line. I video tape the occurrence but when I zoomed in the middle of the orange glow appeared to be white glowing. Camcorder was hard to stabilize kept jumping all over the place.
127,I looked out my upstairs window and noticed a perfect red triangular formation (3 lights). They would dim and disappear in front of eyes and then change form into a perfect straight line. I yelled for my husband to grab the camera which of course isn’t charged.  At least he was able to witness the lights as I did so I know I am not crazy. There was an additional red light at the bottom of the formed lights which I couldn’t see as clear because it was through the trees. It lasted 15 minutes and we just could not look away.  Afterwards there were several helicopter ‘s in the same space circling. Truly spectacular. I still can not believe what we saw. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: ruthief1@hotmail.com
128,The objects start out at first the South and look like stars. Then suddenly they get A little bigger and brighter  and start moving across the sky toward the big dipper (North) and just disappear. I have seen several of the objects lately  and I am wondering if anyone else has also noticed them too.  I have been star gazing for a couple of months now every night  but never noticed them before. They also start twinkling before they move  and approx. five are in an arch position at equal distance from each other. Has anyone else seen these lights? Or  does anyone know what they might be?  I imagine we are not alone  but who knows for sure. I haven’t made contact as of yet. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: jeanie.pohlman@pcc.edu
129,I was driving south towards the ocean to pick up a friend for work between 9-9:30pm and directly in front of me in the sky was a large very bright round orange lights in a v pattern. It was very clear. I stared at it through my windshield what seemed like a good 5 mins or so trying to figure out what it was.  It certainly did not look like an airplane or anything else. Then all of a sudden it started blinking really fast and disappeared. Then I saw a smaller set of rapidly blinking lights directly next to it and then it just disappeared completely. When I got to my friends I told her that I saw something crazy and didn’t know if I was seeing things and she described it and said she had seen the same thing.  I talked to two other people that night who were at different locations at the same time who said that they had seen it as well and described it the same way.
130,The Object went in many different Directions  at one   it was a Solid light in a triangle shape .
131,large round  thin  flat  lime green almost flourescent like with different shades from lighter in the middle to brighter and darker going to the outer rims(similiar to a color wheel in graduation of color). It had a comet like tail  no sound and only saw it for approximately 5-6 seconds before it disappeared into some low lying clouds. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

132,At  12:30 AM on 6/5/11  we were leaving a friend’s house  and a bright light in the sky caught our eye.  At first  my husband thought it was a low flying airplane  but as we continued to watch the flight pattern  speed  and size  there was nothing we know of that could have matched these.  The bright light started out a yellowish and later turned more to a orangeish/redish color.   The flight pattern was NOT a straight line – it moved across the sky  then backward  then forward a few times while also changing speed and distance from the earth.  It was much  much bigger than a star  which is why we mistakened it for an airplane at first  but how it moved and it moved very VERY quickly  we dismissed it as an airplane.  Plus  there was no noise at all.  As the light zig zagged back and forth speeding up and slowing down.   After the erratic flight patterned stopped  the light started getting farther and farther (smaller and smaller) from earth till it disappeared completely from the night sky.  All of this happened in the matter of 30 seconds or so.  Three of us witnessed this event.  Just posting this out there to see if anyone else in the area was outside and witnessed this event.
133,DID NOT SEE OBJECTS  ONLY HEARD SOUNDS FROM (THEM). 3 OBJECTS.  YEAR 1999 IN FALLS PA.
134,looked like a cluster of flames traveling fairly slowly and silently. flight pattern looked like a balloon or a kite. Anybody else see this?
135,It was about 7:30 to 9;30pm. I had just emerged from the subway at 169th st. and Hillside Ave. in Jamaica  New York   I was going to pick up my car to finish my commute home to Long Island. The light and movement caught my eye and I looked up.  There above me moving at moderate speed in a NE direction was a very large disc. The overall illuminated color was that of an incandescent light bulb. On two sides directly across from each other were 2 half moon shaped sections lighted in a solid bright green colored light.  This object made absolutely no sound what so ever. It was reported on the CBS news radio later that evening  but only once. Official report  “an airplane advertising” I being an observer over the years of all types of aircraft  both military and civilian can honestly say this was not a winged craft of any type.  I would like to know if this was reported and archived in any NY newspaper  since hundreds of people saw this disc and called the police. I listened as it was reported on CBS radio at appox. 10:00pm that night..
136,a single like similar to a old style lantern but was strong enough to see far away  If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: pi555@aol.com
137,It appeared as a bright white pulse or flash  much stronger than anything I’ve ever seen  save for lightning. This was no “shooting” star. It would drift in an erractic path  periodically pausing and then flash. Not able to see it unless it flashed.  I say its path was erratic only because it flashed often enough to ‘visually’ track it. Eventually  after 2 or 3 minutes  it disappeared. My daughter witnessed the same behavior in the night sky in the same area on July 7  2017. Could it have been a drone?
138,its been going on for a few weeks now they come up over music mountain and the hill around us they look like they are swaying they stay for hours in the same area looks like they try to fit in to the stars but i can see them as plane as day everyone i have talked to says its the military i don’t think .
139,flying  faster  than a  jet plane If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: maine_hunter2000@yAHOO.COM
140,Stepped outside and one of us pointed up  there was a disc hovering. we watched it for 5-10 min. then it shot off at crazy speed. Just then another one came in and hovered in the same apx. place we watched for a half hr. finally getting in our cars and leaving.Since it wasn’t doing anything. This was a long time ago  but I remember it like it was yesterday  and I have studied everything I can get ahold of ever since. But have never told many people  this is the first time I’ve ever written anything on it. I don’t want to deal with media. OK?
141,On the night of october 1 shortly after midnight I witnessed a series of bright spheres moving across the sky from the south east toward the north west. the spheres were silent and appeared about a minute to a few seconds apart. moving at the same pace seemingly following one another. they were a bright orange in color. at one point one of them seemed to just suddenl vanish.others moved out of sight. they seemed to just appear and faded just as quick.
142,i was 8 years old it was 3’00 afternoon. i went outside to play saw ufo over trees hovering. i turned to get my brother but it sped off in a second it was gone.the next months to follow people were outside at night ufo watching.i no it was real
143,A series of flying objects flying in in numbers of 1 to 3 flew over. Single objects  pairs and groups of three. The groups of two flew typically side by side but had crossed behind each other. The groups of three flew in a triangular formation with one in front and the other two flanking to rear on each side.  The orange light they gave off didn’t blink or flash but seemed to stay at the same intensity and appeared as horizontal oblong shapes.
144,I’ve been looking for somebody to tell the story. A few years ago in a trailer park in Ocala Florida there was this silver ball stationary up in the air it was about 1000 feet up stationary that it was a time I was sitting on my deck about two years ago was late at night the object was facing N I couldn’t believe how big it was you could open it for qualified jumbo jets on its wingspan it came in the front of the object was reddish to the size of three football fields it came in for about 3 seconds that it disappeared it made no noise I’ve ever seen something this big before this is about two o’clock in the morning it was clear night If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

145,I was outside with my daughter we say a gray large boomerang with no lights flying UNDER the cessna plane that was heading towered’s John Wayne airport It had no sound  we only heard the cessna then started flying south when we couldnt see it anymore If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

146,3 red/amber spheres   hovering or moving very slowly   one quickly disappeared  the other 2 remained at exactly the same altitude and stood still for approx 2 minutes  then began to ascend slowly  the left one headed west nw and the 3rd one remained   still amber/ red  as it finally followed the others i got a pic as it got further away but on closer inspection you could see a definite rectangular shape with a shaped top and more shallow bottom   all changed from amber to white as they got further away but took off at an incredible rate   i am by the charlotte airport and their were many airplanes at about the same distance which you could hear but these were completely silent i will forward pic when i can figure out how to do it by phone as it s on my cellphone If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

147,About 7:45 PM  bringing Tristan & Sawyer home Tristan said  “Grandfather are they firefly’s”? I looked and saw some type of lights / aircraft  in waves of 15 to 20  flying in twos & threes going from south to north  in Bellows Falls  VT. We watched at least three waves of them. By the red light they showed (very bright) they did not appear to be very fast. Nor did they appear to be flying very high  but no sound.  They reached a certain point and disappeared or turned their lights off. I would guess 45 to 60 in total. Some others had pulled over to watch also.
148,Me and two friends  (we were all about 11 years old) witnessed the craft which hovered motionless and silent. Strange odor or more like a “taste” in our mouths  hard to explain but it tasted or smelled like battery acid. The UFO didn’t seem to have any lights blinking  more like the craft glowed.
149,I was at a drive in with my mother  sister  friend and other friend. I was on my way back from the bathroom between films and I decided to stop and look up at the sky to search for shooting stars (its been a past time for a while) I saw a bright light it was moving very slowly across the sky.  I watched it for about 20 seconds for it to blink thinking it was a plane or a helicopter  but it didn’t. Suddenly  it moved in a shooting arch with a tail (like the ice on the back of a comet or meteor) toward the trees and it extinguished before it hit any kind of horizon line.

151,As I was traveling south on Cloverdale at ~10:00pm late December 2007  I saw what appeared to be stadium lights on the left side of the road. It was unusual because the lights lit up the ground  but I was not able to see the post they were attached to. I thought it possibly was one of those temporary set ups that they have for night-time road construction or something  but there was no construction.  I slowed the truck down and tried to see what the lights were from  but there wasn’t anything there. The lights were very bright like stadium lights (I think there were 2 rows of like 3 lights/row and 2 larger lights on each side of the row ends). Very large. I went to bed thinking it was very strange to the point that the next day when driving by the same area in the daylight  I looked to see what was there  but there wasn’t anything at all.  No telephone line  post  or other large structure. I live just there  so I know it wasn’t right. Anywho  it obviously was very unsettling because 4 years later I still SWEAR that something unusual was there. Maybe not an ‘alien’ UFO  but no other explanation has made sense.

154,It didn`t have any blinking lights that i could see just a row of white lights top and bottom in the dark rings around the object. This was as you get off at third st off of the watterson xpressway heading downtown and it looked like it made a slight right bank and it went out out of sight behind the tree line.while i was at the stoplight.didn`t have my camera with me.
155,around 6 pm on a clear darkened blue sky my neighbor and i noticed 3 or more UFOs in a triangular position possibly forming a a shape of a crown outside my house. i compared them to the only star that was around (which was very bright);the UFOs were a lot brighter abnormally bright for the distance it had  flashing only a single color white standing motionless in the sky. I left for about 2 hours came back home and looked at the exact position where it was and it wasn’t there.
156,On Oct. 30 2010 @ around 7:45 PM. While driving on Portion Rd in Lake Ronkonkoma my husband and I noticed a light in the sky getting closer. At first we thought it was a plane coming in for a landing at Islip airport.  We realized it was getting too close and maybe it was going to crash. It then separated into two sections and hovered. We then saw two additional objects. They then took off heading west. I was never a believer but this was too real for me.
157,there were 3 to 5 star like lights in the sky that wuld move in one direction stop and disapear only to reappear in a diff location with a diff direction of travle at one point i followed one bright light it disapeared reappeard moved in a zig zag disapeared again and reappeared moved south extremely fast and vanished. this went on for about fifteen mins and after it never happend again what the hell was this? no sound and precision movement unlike any man made object If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

158,I was driving down local rural road and saw something with 4 bright white horizontal lights.  As it grew closer  I noticed it had none of the typical marker lights for an aircraft.  It was coming towards me so I stopped car and got out to get a better look.  Object flew directly over me.  Seemed to drift.  Was about 150 ft above road and over 200 ft long and possibly 50 ft wide.  I counted seconds and object took 4 seconds to fly over me.  Made a very faint pulsating sound. Object was totally black except for the four white lights on the front of it. Was not a helicopter and planes cannot fly that slow. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

159,Like I said “v” shaped very large  it had 6 bright white lights on the bottom….Saw it hovering for like 30seconds….. Then it vanished
160,I was talking to my sister and some of my friends.they started talking to each other  and I happen to look up.what I saw scared me. I saw a group of star (or what I thought were stars at the time) and then they started to move. I tried to get my friends to see  however they could not.I never got to see it go  because I had to go to school. I have a turn on the bus  and when we use the turn we go back by my house. I looked up and it was gone. I never saw it again.
161,I was walking my dog and I saw this thing  it was hovering about a mile in front of me for 15 seconds  I took 3 pics  It resembles a silver mushroom  it was sparkling and shining reflecting the sun  I was considering that this may be one of the Moffett Field blimps but all the sudden took of going up in stray line until loosing it of my view out in the sky.
162,My husband & I noticed the first one while driving northbound on i-65 and I noticed a bright light in the sky kind of low and I pointed it out and when we got right under it  because it wasn’t hardly moving at all  we pulled over and it stood still for a second  long enough for us to see what color it was and everything  then took off.  We turned around to follow so we were now going southbound on 65 and saw a second one high up in the sky but this one was a triangle and was heading striaght up fast. We actually followed the path the first one took and went down some back roads and actually got to see the first one again in an open field just hovering. If anyone has any info they can give me please email me  I’m so interested in this! If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: justmyluck16@yahoo.com
163,thats the second time i have seen the lights slow moving no sound and close together  they just dissappeared in to the sky
164,Only saw the bigger one first. At first it was stationary at about 60 degrees in the eastern sky. Then it either turned or extended something from it’s side  but a long protrusion(long and skinny)came out of it’s north side.  At this point I ran into my office to get my video camera only to discover it had a dead battery. By this point the craft had started moving east slowly and there were a bunch of smaller white orb looking things all around it moving to the west  each moving somewhat irratically. But in general they were moving west.  The larger craft was out of sight by this point. I was able to run back in and grab my still 12 meg camera in time to get a couple of pictures of some of the smaller ones. My only problem is I can’t upload them because I can’t find the cord. I will when I either find the cord or try to get a new one. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: releasethechicken@yahoo.com
165,UFO’s with Aliens
166,fast seemed like it had a destination travelin was mantain a certain speed and hight at the hole time had like force field orge around it keep slowlee but fastly change in form very hard 2 explain
167,I woke up around 6am and saw what looked like an airplane.  But then noticed that the object stayed in the same position for a few minutes.  I woke my husband up to look at the object. The object moved in a zig zag movement.  Moving back and forth and up and down and no movement at times.  The object had white lights  but at times there were red and blue lights too.  I watched the object until about 6:45am when the object started moving  further away (maybe 10-15miles). If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

168,Driving down route 85  two large lights over the tree line caught my eye  not only due to brightness but it wasnt moving either. As I Caught up with the lights  it slowly emerged from the tree line. On the front of the craft there was a red light  the two white were in the back.  On the sides the only way I can describe this is crackling or glittering lights. It then started picking up speed so i turned down the closest rd to follow. I had a very clear view to the end of this rd  about a half mile. It was moving so fast but  couldnt hear any noise from the craft. It moved away from me so fast it became a speck  then seemed to just dissapear into a star. I checked with locals from the area  and military planes have been known to fly over lakes.  The only problem with this is the military hasn’t developed anywhere near the speed I saw that craft go. Just the way it moved and looked  I knew it wasnt from this world.
169,When my mom and i where walking to our friends house at night time  i look up into the sky then i say this wierd circle shape and an oval on top of it. i told my mom LOOK MOM A UFO!!!! then my mom said WOW. then all of suddenly it just went by really fast and no sound nor nothing to it at all. it had red  blue  AND green colors to it.
170,two flashing objects traveling east thought they were airplanes but then one turned south. we lost sight of the one going south but continued viewing one going east when lights dispersed and were flashing in a sporadic display.kind of like looking at fireworks exploding in the sky but they remained constant not burning out like a firework would. these objects made no sound
171,A friend and I saw 2 red lights traveling South towards C.A.F.B. We thought it was a b-52 landing  they flew non-stop back in 1980. As we drove closer  the lights stipped and traveled North and began flying over a valley to the North of us.  One was blinking red  the other  solid red. There was no sound of any engines  just the breeze could be heard. The lights were slowly swinging around each other. We stipped on the side of the road  others pulled over  jumping out and shouting  ‘there it is!’. The lights hovered above us out over the valley  seemingly  like they were interacting with us  acknowledging us.  They continued to swing around each other until they  finally began drifting slowly to the NorthEast  out over the country. We tried to follow them  but  there were no paved roads headed in that direction. I had found out later that there had been ufo sightings in France and even the Famous ufo case in Brittain where the military witnessed the landing of a ufo.

172,The sighting took place on the beach just after the free movie at the boardwalk ended. My family and I saw two bright orange colored objects. I thought they were triangles shaped but my kids thought they were round. They flew in a couple of seconds apart from the north. They seemed to descend as they approached then started to slow then rise. One seemed to ascend almost straight up all the way out of sight  seemingly out of the atmosphere. The other flew west over the ocean and then flew straight up If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: mohill49er@gmail.com
173,Ijust thank are gods that there were two of us who seen them.How the air force picked thenm up on radar is another mystery unknown.For as of me Natasha i have seen this twice in my life time.And i am as sain as all of you.The sane nite a lady two miles away had seen the very same thing my husband and i had the privledge to see.10-9-2010 If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

174,it was triangular..had v shaped lights about 10 lights together like u see a bowling pin row…it flew about 2 to 1 noticle miles an hour and at first it looked like a glowing flok of birds in a perfect alighnment but birds dont glow
175,Between 2-2:30 p.m today  I stopped in a shopping plaza to purchase a coffee with my brother  mother  and niece. Upon entering the car to leave  I looked south  when something up in the sky caught my attention. It was there that I saw rows of perfectly symmetrical balls  and lines of what I can only describe as cloud like formations .  After taking a picture  I started driving in that direction to get a better look  video taping it the whole way  and as I were doing so  more “balls”  and lines continued to appear out of no where  making another column. There was no plane. No sound. There was absolutely no explination for what was the cause behind it.  I parked the car  and myself and my brother got out of the car  and continued looking. It was then to the west  that my mother spotted some aircraft  of a very shiny  silver nature  appear and fly very slowly. I too looked and saw it  followed it for about 5 seconds  and then it disappeared right there before my eyes.  This happened two more times. It disappeared right there with us looking at it and would reappear in the same spot. I have never seen anything like what I saw today in  my life. These cloud like formations did not dissipate right away.  We stayed there looking at them for 15 minutes  and they were still there when we drove away. I am uploading two pictures that I took. Also in one of the pictures that I had taken  to the right of the formations  there is an unexplainable object in the picture.

176,My first thought was it was like the moon coming down in the field  by the huge size(larger than a hot air balloon-only perfectly round) and it was glowing. I thought it was going to crash  but then it vanished.  I never forgot about it  to this day. I was too embarrassed to report it. Was wondering if anyone else ever seen this besides me. I don’t know that it was a weather balloon.
177,I have pictures posted on facebook david strider living in Thailand from tacoma  Washington area pictures were high resolution and can be enlarged.  If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: dave-strider@hotmail.com
178,It frist look like a bright flare but then changed to a bright red orange and as it came lower I snaked the pictures of this UFO it hovered in the night sky for10min before it fadded out of sight I saw a different UFO it was smaller than the red orange one it went toward the mountains.

179,Well  I was 10y/o at the time  my Mom and I were living in a 2bed/1bath apartment in Chowchilla  which is a small somewhat rural farming town in the San Joaquin Valley in California. Anyways  (the following is important to the story so please bear with me) I remember the day and events therein vividly  because it was unlike any other before or since  and the first & only UFO I’ve ever seen in my almost 23 years alive.  So  I mentioned that that just me & my Mom lived in an apartment  where our cat Salem had recently had a litter of kittens  and 1 of them loved to sleep underneath this rocking lazyboy chair  that day I flopped into the recliner which killed the kitten. I realized what I did and felt so bad I began  crying so inconsolably that my Mom  desperate to cheer me up took me to Merced to see ‘Scary Movie’ which coincidently opened in theatres that day.  It worked in taking my mind off the tragedy from earlier in the day  opening day of the film meant the theatre was at near max capacity. It was probably about 9pm when the movie ended  and everyone who came out through the front exit noticed everyone was looking to the sky(some had cell phones and cameras filming the UFO  but I can’t find any footage or even reports on the web… Odd  huh?) And me and mom  as well as the 100 or so people who came outside with us  were amazed when we saw what everybody was looking at which the crowd unanimously agreed was a real live UFO.   I’LL TRY FROM WHAT I CAN REMEMBER IN ACCURATE DETAIL TO DESCRIBE WHAT I  AND MANY OTHERS SAW IN THE NIGHT SKY OF JULY 7  2000. I FULLY SWEAR TO THE TRUTH OF EVERYTHING SAID IN MY PERSONAL DESCRIPTION: -whatever it may have been was above earths atmosphere  too high for any discernable features to be seen with the naked eye  the clearly visible thing was what the UFO was emitting as it hovered there; which appeared to be similar to how our jet planes leave that smoke-gas cloud trail behind them  marking where it had flown from.  if not for the trail of! bright glowing green cloud of gas it left in its wake  we wouldve been oblivious  to it. It no doubt was more than a mile up  when we saw it  it had already been there for 20 minutes or so somebody told us. And only 1/3 of the total shape made from the UFOs smoke trail was there. We stood watching as it  very slowly  flew over us eventually making a complete half circle  and unlike smoke and gasses we are familiar with  this fluorescent smoke-like gas trail behind the UFO didn’t expand  change shape  lose density  or gradually dissipate in the course of maybe 45minutes to an hour that we observed the strange phenomena. The craft only became visible to me when it appeared to glow  as if to power up  this lasted less than 5 seconds before zooming away faster than my eye could follow  so I can’t tell you if it headed north  south  east  or west. Although it’s fluorescent smoke flight path marker maintained shape  size  color  density  and fluorescence for about 10 minutes after the UFO made its sudden departure  then began to behave like we see a cloud behave in the sky on a sunny day  although It did remain a visible fluorescent green in its “C” shape for roughly 2 1/2 hours thereafter.  If anybody from Merced who happened to see the UFO in the sky that night  or better yet have actual footage somewhere of the UFO over Merced (and possibly seen elsewhere in the San Joaquin Valley) on JULY of 2000  please email me. I FULLY BELIEVE THAT WHAT I WITNESSED WAS EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL OR A SECRETIVE GOVERNMENT SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIMENT OF SOME KIND  AND WAS BRUSHED UNDER MEDIA ATTENTION AND COVERED UP  BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE FOOTAGE OF IT NEVERTHELESS. GOD BLESS AND QUESTION EVERYTHING! Adios If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: mcholtzclaw@yahoo.com
180,Looking at the stars in clear night sky in winter feb. and suddenly appears a big cloaked  triangle   floats on  like it knows that I’m seein it  and then goes supper fast away. had 5 dots like on in front  two behind them and two behind the others.   all were the same distanss as the others.
181,me and my friend went out to smoke a cigarette  we looked up in the sky and saw two orange balls with a blue ring around them  we watched them for about 15 seconds until they diappeared. it seemed like they were flying away from earth because they just got smaller and smaller until they were gone
182,This is in response to an post I just saw titled Aurora  Illinois USA August 11th 2012 by someone named John. I also live in Aurora and I might have 2 pictures that could be similiar to the event you described.

183,4 orange spheres moving from the west to east above Martin’s Plaza in Connellsville PA. They appeared to have some sort of flame or shield encasing the light inside with a bright orangish glow  they were moving in a unison form then spread apart and started disappearing out of the sky. More then 10 people pulled off of 119 to see the event.
184,that night i was down at camp in harrisburg while my parents were in state college that night i was riding on the back of a trailer on a tractor with me was maybe 10 15 people all of us saw it and the same time so did my parents what i saw was no space shuttle too big it didn’t last long
185,July 1984 I was 12 years old  a friend and I where camping in his backyard it was about 1100 pm at night and we went for a walk around the block and visited some other friends in the neighborhood.  when we returned to his house and jumped his fence to get into our tent we looked up and saw this huge ship at tree top level flying overhead it took up the whole night sky all I could see where lighted portals it was an  easy 100 yards wide by maybe 200 to 300 yards long and all I could hear was this slight humming sound. I will never forget this night for the rest of my life. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: nathan.kuhl1@gmail.com
186,Driving to work Saturday night north toward hershey at approx 2230.  Saw 1 bright orange light in the sky north/northeast of hershey.  Object was in the sky for approx. 5 minutes with no movement and then suddenly dissappeared.   I didnt think anything of it until last night  july 23rd.  Again driving north toward hershey  this time 2 very bright orange objects in the sky  very visible from elizabethtown which is approx 10 miles from hershey.  Objects stayed in the same spot for about 15-20 minutes.  They could have been there longer but my view had been obstructed once I got into town.  I have no idea what these objects could have been.   On saturday during the day  I thought I saw a military drone fly over the hershey area (we have a military base within about 20 miles of hershey) so I wasnt surprised of this  dont know if this could be related or not.  Would like to hear of other reports to see if other people had a better view. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: ldvballguy@comcast.net
187,Hovering over the town and when the headlights of our car faced it  the aircraft was gone in a split second with no sound.. 6 white lights  1 blinking red light
188,It sliced above me on Route 6 so fast I expected it to crash in Old Furnace but there was no crash. Its glow makes it unforgetable and it was reported in the Norwich Bulletin the nexty day. I remember the sighting but not the year. Mid 90’s. Ten years later I saw a similar object on UFO Hunter  it only hit me then that I had seen a UFO.

189,I saw ahead of me a huge bank of bright lights as I was driving up SR 444.  I thought they were new stadium lights high over what had been a large vacant field. When I reached the area I opened my car window and leaned out to look up at the lights. I couldn’t see any stars or the moon. I heard no sounds. Nothing was moving either.   I was puzzled as I had not noticed any construction in that area and decided to look at the lights the next day in daylight. When I returned I found nothing there which would provide lights. There was no construction  no lights  and no cleared fields; only weeds and brush.  This is near Wright-Patterson AFB  but the lights were too close to be an airplane. It would have been about to land in the field with lights as close above as these were. Also there would have to been sound from an airplane or helicopter. However  there was no sound at all.
190,Initially thought it was a jet without contrails  but upon further observation  shape was clearly round. Sighting lasted approximately 5 seconds.
191,I was walking from my home to my friends house down the block  6/29/13 about 9:26 pm I noticed something across the street hovering about the height of a stop sign.  I was shocked but not fearful  I started to walk towards the object that I couldnt identify..amazed  i got about 10ft from the translucent sphere..looked like a clear but not shiny circle about the size of a washing machine..and what looked like a red flame in the center. The ufo then decended up over the trees when I took out my phone to catch what I could on video.  When the ufo was very high in the dark sky it simply looked like a pulsating red circle and then just dissapeared.
192,I and a friend were eating ice cream when a bright red arch quickly appeared in the sky. I expected fireworks however it leveled off and flew right over us. No sound  2 bright red lights in front one over the other like this : when it passed the back side was not lit but still enough light in the sky to see. A large round oval mass  it was dark colored. Then looked to the left where it came from and there was 3 more coming. My best guess is about 2000 feet off of the ground.
193,I was watching fireworks when I saw an orange fiery object that looked like a hot air balloon on fire. I live in the city and I thought someone a couple blocks down the street set off a new firework but it looked like a ball of fire slowly coming up my street which I thought looked dangerous.  As it slowly went over my house  it looked more yellow and was not blinking and I heard no plane sounds but as I looked directly up at it  it could have been at airplane altitude but still was very bright yellow and continued to the western horizon when it either went over a cloud or just went out. Unless it was all the fireworks smoke in the air distorting a plane  although the stars weren’t distorted  it was something that I’ve never seen in my 68 years. I was mesmerized. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: jimdrish@gmail.com
194,started off like a flame in the sky then appeared to be a flame within a ball type.. moves slowly yet intelligently  not like a balloon then disappears faster and faster as it travels northeast
195,I was driving home from work at approx. 10:35 pm when I saw 2 cars pulled over and the passengers were looking at the sky. When I looked over to the east I saw the 3 yellowish lights that formed a huge triangle. I couldn’t tell if they were 3 separate objects or one big one with 3 lights. They were not moving but disappeared in an instant.  I immediately called my friend that was heading home from work at the same time and he handed the phone to his wife saying  “You need to talk to her”. She had seen the exact same thing from the Salisbury bypass that leads to Rt. 50 east. I’m really glad someone else had seen it because people have a tendency to disbelieve sightings like this. It (or they) was definitely not a plane or helicopter.
196,balls of lights seemed to have spotted me watching them they tried to make me think I was seeing things when they flew in line themselves up with a star formation cassipoia ? they lined themselves up hiding between me and star formation the five bright stars in that formation in the northeast sky this had been the second sighting of the night around 9:30 pm you can read story at ufo-talk oobs of lights watch’n’ me.
197,Around 9:15 pm I heard a helicopter fly low outside my house coming from west. I went outside onto my driveway and could not locate the helicopter but immediately heard the sound of a low flying fighter jet traveling at a very high speed chasing an object moving south easterly and moving much faster. The craft had three windows lite in white light. It was maybe 5 times as large as the plane keeping comfortable distance ahead. I watch until  I could no longer hear or see them anymore.
198,At first I saw one and then three appeared. They were dancing around like other UFO’s I have seen in videos. They were circling each other and turning 90 degrees in mid flight. I have no pictures but  I do have one from my vacation in Costa Rica.
199,two white lights of same intensity. One approchoaching the other. Then merged as one and moved on.
200,in Northwestern sky. I was looking up while walking dog and thought it was a star but then looked again and v formation  just standing still for around 10 minutes then nothing.
201,We were having fun at my cousins dance program when  we decided to go out and play.It was very cold so I looked up to gaze at the stars.Suddenly from nowhere this semi-circle bed to black thing appeared and i shoted ufo. My friends looked up and saw the thing. It was emmiting light as it went upwards.We tried to take a photo but it dissapeared.
202,my sister  my son and myself were lying in the back of a pick up truck in a canyon where we had gone to pick up and adopt two mustangs.   When we arrived  many people were parked all around the area waiting for dawn to start selection.  as we watched the sky we saw a cluster of 4 bright moving objects turning from yellow to red to white and it looked as though they were playing tag as they would swoop together  then splay apart in opposite directions at such a speed you almost couldn’t see it  one minute they were in one spot  the next second had zipped to another spot across the sky always zipping back together then apart as though they were playing…all of us saw it and watched them until it began to be light and they could be seen no longer…it was really cool.
203,viewed object for 20min on dixie springs road from my vehicle  object appeared initialy to be on fire  color changed every 30sec or so from intense red to light orange  after 30min just disappeared.

204,i saw this last night i kent  ohio approx 9:45. was standing on haymaker street  lights were above the river  moving rapidly up toward the north east. also did see a passenger plane headed to the northwest (i assume to the cleveland ariport) and was able to have a visual reference- definitely not planes  too high to be copters (we have a guard base nearby).  if it was orbiting satellites  wouldn’t they appear be traveling in the opposite direction? formation looked like this: * * *      * *
205,very huge white dark spot in the middle and lights going all around it
206,going down highway 99 to 198 about 530 to maybe 600 look to my left off 99 seen this tear drop falling slow from sky thinking to my seif this is it waiting for a big boom just over the mt so i made it to 198 going to visalla ca griping my stearing wheel punch the gas around the corner to se it again it was gone. it look like to me a giant falling star but way to big and to slow If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

207,My friend and I were driving down to southern Louisiana to see some friends. I had just snowed here  and they closed down the highway. Going against advice from friends  we drove anyway.  I had driven in snow before  and was not worried about it. There was only one other car on the highway during our travels  and I kept them in front of me at a distance. As we were driving  we both noticed this orange glow in the sky  that was pulsating.  Like a heartbeat. It looked to be about two miles away  and as we kept driving we realized that we were about to go right beside it. As we got closed to this glow  the car in front of us slammed on its brakes  and I actually had to swerve to miss them.  The glow was on the other side of the interstate. The right side of 1_49 N  we were on 1-49 S in the right lane. We were in the middle of nowhere  there were no other lights around  it was level with the tops of the trees  and it was not moving.  We could not make out what was causing the glow  either. It was a misty  huge  pulsating orange glow. Whenever we passed by it  I became very nervous and my eye started twitching. I sped up to pass it  and did not look back in the mirror.  I have never in my life seen anything like it  and I have no idea what it could have been. No  I was not high. No  I was not drunk. No  I was not tired. I was awake  aware  and driving with a friend. We both have no idea what we witnessed.  I only feel bad because we did not have a camera to capture it. But  honestly? I was too scared to even think about that. I felt like if I tried anything  the end result would not be good. I can not explain what I felt. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

212,pinville matthews road area…1/13/11. I saw a super bright light in the sky that was oddly shaped and looked like it was moving slightly around in a cirle. then several smaller crafts with red and yellow lights zooming in the sky. wtf??? I have never seen anything like it. I was terrified.
213,It was cloudy outside with spotty cloud cover. I noticed a quick bright flash of white light  not knowing where it had come from I looked up into the sky. The white flash dipped behind a cloud and a red light seemed to race out in a straight line from where the white light vanished from and into the cloud cover. I am certain that it was not a plane because the normal air traffic does not fly over this area and also I would have noticed it when I first step outside because I looked up at the sky when I got on to the porch. Also planes do not just lose lights on their wings  which normally has a red blinking light on the tip and this red light was not blinking  and plane white lights are not that bright when they are at cruising altitude.

214,me  my wife  and mother witnessed a bright amber light in the sky over the ocean from the15th floor of ocean forest villas. light disappeared and then turned into 3 amber lights. lights seemed to hover  disappear  then shine again. they moved south down the strip staying over the ocean  then back north. at one point there were two sets of lights parallel with each other only slightly staggered. this lasted for about 3 mins before disappearing. i have never witnessed anything like this before  and i am a huge sceptic but this frightened me.

215,Saw a super bright light in sky  orange at 21:00.  Wasn’t sure what it was  since meteorite’s ‘fall’ or go across the sky.  This was stationary. Then it broke into 5 seperate bright lights.  They disappeard and then showed again many many miles across the sky.  My wife and daughter also saw these lights. I never thought I would see ‘UFO’s until pigs fly.  My daughter now says  yeah  they were flyng pigs.   These were NOT airplanes  or anything we’ve made. 37 Years old  and the first time I’ve ever mentioned seeing anything of the sort.

216,It looked like a red glowing ball floating through the sky. It was above a house for a little while  then hovered really fast south and went higher and higher into the sky. You could then see the red object with the stars and it faded away. It was moving way too fast to be a balloon and there was no wind. I’d say it was moving 100mph and really abruptly.

217,i am a roofer. i was leaving a job site. i was going up a hill and came to a stop sign. at this angle my vision was directed towards the top of a bluff and the stars on a cloudless sky.  I then noticed that the stars were being blocked out by a large t-shaped object moving slowly to the north. I knew this because it would block out the stars as it moved. It made no sound  and had no lights.  It moved very slowly. Too slow to be a plane or anything else i can think of. I know what i saw. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

219,very bright star shaped object orange  red in colour travelling very fast but without any kind of sound   followed by another with same characteristics about 5 sec later  never saw anything like this all my life  still shacking 25 minutes after.
220,It was mid winter.  My brother and I were outside sledding down a hill in our front yard. It was just after dinner  and since we lived in a pretty rural area  it was quite dark outside other then the porch lights on the house. As I was taking my turn down the hill I heard a sound above us like a “whirring”… over and over “whirr”..”whirr”..”whirr”. Not loud  but very quiet.  When I looked up I saw a large  “saucer shaped” object hovering about 200 – 300 feet above the tree tops.  It was a dark metallic color with lights rotating around the center.  It was moving very slowly in an upward direction  and splitting into two pieces.  One half seemed to stay in place while the other was lifting upward. That is all I saw before yelling to my brother to run in the house with me. I was VERY scared!  I tried and tried to get my parents outside to see it  but they did not believe what I was saying. When I FINALLY got them outside  it was gone. The following day my mother was talking to our neighbor  and she told her about what her and her husband witnessed while they were outside that same night.  She described the exact same thing as I did. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: mtolan@charter.net

225,the front looked like a flock of birds  White and fluttering in and out of a roundish shape much larger than any flock of birds could be and moving way to fast.  Far to low to be a plane and moving to fast to be other known aircraft. the rear was another smaller fluttering changing mass of lights  between them you could make out a hull shaped form of gray connecting the two fluttering forms If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

228,walking on a path to go down to the beach in small cove…looked out and saw this ufo hovering over a fishing boat anchored in the cove…all of a sudden a cone shaped light came on from the under-side of the ufo..very bright and white in color..then..another light came on..lime green in color..smaller cone shaped light inside the larger white light….this all lasted maybe 15sec. Then..the ufo took off very fast(no noise at all) up in the clouds If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: steve.houston@perkins-electric.com
229,I have never followed UFO sightings and am not sure what I saw but I am hoping someone else saw as well. I worked last night as a private duty nurse in amhesrt nh in a house on top of a big hill which has a great view in the direction of west I think.  Looked at bathroom window and though I saw a shooting star then realized it was something else as it didn’t go away. The backyard is about a little larger than a football field and at the tree line furthest back I saw the object. It was extremely bright and gold toned.  It moved from side to side and up and down a few times  I then realized it wasn’t a plane as well as I’ve never seen anything in the sky so bright and it moved with quick jerky motions. It only moved in a small area as far as not around the whole sky. It stayed at the treelike but im not sure how far back so I can’t estimate the size.  Please any answers would be greatly appreciated  I really am in hopes to find someone who saw it as well. Thanks If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

237,I counted 11 of these silently moving orange/yellow “globes” moving almost in formation about 1000 ft up in the cloudy night sky. My friend took a photo and if they are brought in closer  on inspection you can detect a disc-like shape above the “lights.”

239,We have sat out side for the last 5 nights and have watched this orb change colors and move in small movements.  It stays every night for 2 hours or so in the same area. We watched a plane pass under it in a distance and it actually moved down and then back up as the plane passed. It moves around and puts on a light show changing colors. Then it seems to slowly go off to the west.  To many nights to be a weather balloon and I don’t think satellites  move around like that. We will be watching again tonight to the west !!!
240,My mom was letting the dog outside when she noticed something lighting up the back yard (5:45am apprx). She saw what looked to be a disk shaped object with man white lights and arms that radiated out with lights. It hovered in the air silently.  Frightened she ran inside to get my dad and it was gone when she returned.
241,A white light  which began to pulse  then grew higher in intensity as itwent from a complete stop to a very high rate of speed(It went from one side of the sky  to the other almost instantly  but was very very smooth in motion and straight in its trajectory.) At the end of its “trip” the intensity dissipated to a soft glow  and it pulsed a bit again. It made a 180 degree turn and the whole thing repeated. Intensity increased  it shot back to the other side of the sky.  after a while another appeared and was doing the same thing. A third appeared and at this time they began to make a triangle shape in the sky  with the tracers of the lights making the “lines” of the triangle.  No way it was a conventional plane or even a rocket. it was just too fast. They traveled thousands of miles across the sky in a second or less… If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: stone4779@yahoo.com
242,I too saw lights just after midnight in the Balloch area of Cumbernauld i must have counted about a dozen fiery coloured lights floating in formation high in the sky and just put it down to Chinese lanterns it being a new year.Im glad other folk saw them as i was just looking out my window before going to bed.
243,The sky was perfectly clear this night and there was absolutely no noise at all  not even a sonic boom.  I mention that because the view that I had of this event provided me with the aprox. location (from and to) giving me a length of travel for the duration that I witnessed it.   I would estimate that the object traveled roughly 22 miles in a matter of 4 seconds (19 800 mph)before I could not see it any longer.  Certainly didn’t have a camera with me at the time and couldn’t get to one fast enough to share the event but I’ll have one with me soon enough everytime I step out for a smoke.   It’s been cloudy every night since the incident but I try to scan the sky for 45 mins or so each night now  quite exciting! If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

245,It ascended into the sky maybe 30 blocks away from my house….and as it reached it’s peak I could hear the sound of the engine which sounded absolutely nothing like a helicopter or a plane….there’s no way it was loud enough to be a plane or helicopter…..it had one solid red light showing when I was facing north watching it and by the time it made a huge u turn route around the city  I was facing south and I could see two lights…they looked like brake lights on a car but when both lights were exposed  the right one was flashing…..there were no white head lights..and there were no blue lights…..and maybe 2 minutes after it disappeared I saw and hear a helicopter…which was 2 or 3 times louder than what I hear flying around my house….it was just way too quiet to be a plane!

246,Last Summer 2008  while gazing over Tonka Mountain in the town of Petersburg Alaska I saw a bright light moving accross the sky.  At first I thot it was a fly over plane to Anchorage.  I watched it and it dimmed down and disappeared. This summer July 8th  2009 I was taking my 18 year old son and his friend Kenny to the Ferry Terminal at 12:30 in the middle of the night.  My 13 year old daughter was with us as well.  We looked up at 2 bright stars in the sky and commented on them as they were so close together and so bright.  Then one dimmed down and then the other dimmed down.  Then the first one went out and then the second one went out.  It was a perfectly clear night with no cloud cover at all.  We were elated as I have been scanning the skys ever since my first sighting last summer. A week later I saw lights that dimmed and disappeared again in the same part of the sky  south of the town of Petersburg. Then just last week about July 19  2009 or so  my daughter was standing at the sink of our boat brushing her teeth before bed.  We are commercial fishers and live in the harbor while in port. She saw again in the southern part of the sky a bright light.  She thought it might be a reflection as sometimes lights reflect off the windows  so she opened the window to gaze directly at the light.  First it dimmed down and then it became brighter  then it dimmed down again and disappeared entirely. I have been scanning the skys endlessly since my first sighting and am convinced Petersburg Alaska  frequently if not constantly has a UFO presence watching it. Thanks for listening.
247,I was taking to a neighbor when we both saw a row of lights  8 or 9 moving slowly towards our direction. thorn it moved in sequence to my right and then after looking at it for 2 min  it fast. I called the airport that night and said to me  no reports of it came in. yea right  they must of thought I was nuts. it’s now 2012  as I watched Catching UFOs on NATGEO  some other person around the same year I saw this Strang object around 9pm had captured it on video. call me crazy but this is cool!
248,first noticed them at 93rd st and oak park. i kept an eye on them til 91st and homestead. neighbor also saw it and asked if i knew what it was. they traveled in a vertical line with each other.
249,I was watching out my back door window because  of the wind that nite. We were all doing that because of our storm warnings here  I was noticing the bright moon also then i saw a dark long object go across the moon very fast i couldn’t believe what i saw. I have seen something in the past  and could not believe i would see something again. I was told you do.                             cathy
250,just standing on the beach with my boyfriend we saw these 3 extremely bright glowing balls in a perfect row above the ocean. (they were too high in the sky to be boats  and too large and not flashing like a satellite would.) then one disappeared and the two left moved closer together  about 8 seconds later the third reappeared and like moved ontop of one of the other lights. then they all went out.  wondering if anyone else saw this about 8 more people walked up to us asking if we saw that too. about 5 minutes later two of the lights reappeared almost directly infront of us above the ocean and seemed to be a lot closer to us. one glowed then went out then a little to the left another glowed and then the first light reappeared and the two slowly began moving closer together until they united  glowed brightly then went out.  I knew nobody would believe us but around 10 people stopped and asked us if we saw the lights too. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

251,No discernable noise  steady S>N path  constant speed. Fm grnd level  appeared to be relative to size of pencil eraser. Despite being July 4  not believed to be a floating ash fm firewks. Direction/speed steady until until behind tree line. Unable to photo.
252,I was alone  arriving home after work at 10:35 pm. I looked up at the sky as I parked my car and saw 3 large disk shaped lights of an orange color (they seemed rather flat) that were in a triangular formation. They did not move.  The lights just suddenly vanished  all at the same time. I’d probably been looking at them for 2 minutes. There was no sound. I work at a hotel and just had some guests who were in Ocean Isle Beach  sighted 3 orange lights the night before my sighting that seemed to be “playing with stars” out over the ocean.  They saw the triangular formation again the following night  July 19  2012 over the ocean again but staying very still. I’m glad I wasn’t the only one that saw this. It was pretty amazing.

253,I was wearing driving sun glasses  these have a certain color lens (amber)to help with visibility. I could see the UFO quite clearly. It appeared out of nowhere in the sky  flew in and out of the clouds then  just like that  gone!
254,It was about 9:45 pm to 10:00 pm on June-30-2012. I was outside when i saw this orange circular object. i sat for a minute and wondered what it could be and grabbed my teloscope. When i got outside it was gone  but then another circular orange object appeared.  I watched it but it was going to fast so i couldnt see it in my teloscope. Then that one dissapeared and another circular orange object appeared and i watch it. They were all going the same direction. Which was North. And they all were traveling the exact same speed.  I have seen these type of objects in thhe sky  but I have never seen ones like this before.
255,All the neighbor dogs were barking and it woke me up.  I looked out the kitchen door to see what they were barking about. It was very cloudy out and I saw what I thought was the moon coming thru the clouds.  After it came out  the dogs stopped barking. I saw it hover just under the clouds over my neighbors house (there were no trees so I had a direct view).  I was mesmorized by it and stepped out on the patio to get a better look….It was silent and kept jarting back and forth into the clouds.   It looked like a bright disc shapped object.  Once I was outside  I saw another bright light coming thru the clouds. I wanted to run in and tell my parents  but at the same time was intrigued by what it was going to do next.  I felt frozen as I watched it dart back and forth several times.  After a few minutes  it jarted back into the clouds with lightening speed and both lights disappeared.  I’ve never seen anything move so fast)  It reminded me of a hummingbird.   I went inside and told my mom to come out and what I saw.  She stood outside with me for about 20 minutes  but it did not come back.  I called the UFO hotline and the police came to take the report.  They told me that a couple of police officers followed a UFO over to the state line before they lost it.  They publicized in the Alliance newspaper the next day  along with others who had seen it also.   The HS Band Teacher saw one also.  I live in Phoenix now and have heard about the 5 lights over phoenix.  It has happened twice now.  I have not seen them.
256,On the beach  an orange light was noticed coming down the beach. It immediatly flew into the sky. It was clearly seen to be saucer shaped. It rotated around then sped off diagonally away and dissapeared. Two people witness the same thing at the same time and verify.
257,Just after midnight Thursday morning my wife and daughter were looking out the window (east) and noticed a very large bright round object moving in the sky. At first I told them it was probably Mars (looking very large) but then noticed the object was moving from up in the sky down toward the horizon. It was a constant glow moving very constant and slow. We all first mistook it for a planet (Mars  Jupiter) at first glance but the movement immediately surprised us. It was yellowish and fluctuated to orange then back to yellowish. It appeared so high in the sky that is why we first thought of Mars. The movement was slow and constant. No tail  no jittering  very slow. The night was very clear and the night sky and other stars and such visible. We are in Libby Montana living outside of town and have an excellent view of the night sky.
258,Sonic boom over the ocean  which was reported everywhere  came first and I went outside on my second floor balcony when I seen glowing green lights.Green!! First one then another and kept on and on for 5 min or longer. The pattern to me was they are trying to communicate. No pattern one on then off. One longer then  off. One then to the left then over to the right and then one which looke really close to Ocean Isle or Holden Beach N.C. When they stopped I went in for a while until I heard another boom and didn’t see anything until I looked straight up and seen clearly high altitude planes with blinking lights hauling ass out to sea where the boom came from. 8 or more jets.  Shaw Airforce base said they knew nothing  but I know that is a lie. There was an event going on that I can not exactly explain. The airforce was full aware though. I seen them.
259,Whole episode: 3-5 minutes.  All objects orange.  3 were closely grouped  1 was more Northern  1  the largest came from the East.  All objects hovered indepentently and silently for 3-5 minutes until joined by the largest from the East.   As the largest approached the group of 3 the northernmost one started moveing North.  Once they all began moving Northward they were out of sight range in 4-5 seconds  always completely silent.  I have the video  no still shots.

260,we were on a hill parked  noticed 4 objects with orange glow moving very very slow coming from the ocean towards us  got out the binoculars and viewed them  the bottom of the disc’s had orange glowing lights  configuration reminded me of a honeycomb all lit up…a man walking with 2 dogs had gone by us like 10 mins. earlier  a car with 3 people stopped and viewed them also  2 more objects appeared  same configuration after the first 4 disappeared  the man with dogs come back by and stopped  said he saw them also  today Sun. the 12th another man that works at the Rockland P.O. saw them from his deck the same time in Rockland If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

261,At 9:05 PM I noticed a light in the sky that I at first thought was a plane heading in my direction. However  after a few minutes I noticed that the object had not changed its position.  I grabbed my binoculars and was able to see this object with its rapidly flashing lights. The colors ranged from red  blue  green  aqua  pink  white and flashed in no distinct pattern.  The object remained in the same spot for 40 minutes. An employee of mine arrived and was also able to see what I was seeing. I called a friend who lives two towns north of me and he also could see the same object.  After another 5 minutes of observing  the object than started to either descend or head further west and my view of the object was blocked by a mountain.

263,I was traveling east on I 90 at approx. 8pm.  a flying object in front of me to the right was crossing the road.  What was odd that there was what looked like 2 strong lights  like if a plane was going to land. As it got closer to me  I noticed there were actually three lights.  NO strobe or flashing lights. As it reached over my head I looked tho the left out my window and (noticed it was appox 1000ft or lower)saw a triangular object with each light near the points.  It did not move fast. maybe 60-100 mph.  I only saw it for about 30 seconds since I was near hilly areas of the pike and it disappeared over those hills-mountains.  My daughter was in the car with me and saw the same thing.

267,It was dusk my girlfriend and I were headed back from Bartlet Lake going south on scottsdale road. First three star bright orbs appeared in the shape of a triangle ahead of us in the sky  i pointed them out as we approached there were three more orbs in a lateral line headed south.  As we came to the on ramp of the 101 freeway one of the orbs in the triangle formation broke away and moved towards us. As it approached the bright light of the orb disappeared and a black triangle appeared in its place. Its was at least 100 yards if not more from point to point of the edges.  It was triangluar but square not rounded. This craft hovered over the freeway and our vehicle maybe 100ft above from scottsdale road to 7th street. It was very visible. It looked like it had four windows or ports on each side of the craft. It was almost silent except for a hum or buzz.  I remember a very distinct feeling as i watched this craft that i was being watched back it was a very uneasy feeling. We tried to take photos with our phones but of course they didnt capture the image. Frighten we continued driving to get the heck out of there.  I looked around us as we drove there must of been hundreds if not thousands of people on the freeway that day and I never heard or seen anything about the event. I ve researched what i saw and an object called the Illinois triangle is exactly what i saw that day.  i went to a ufo convention and spoke wit a few people that insisted that what i saw was a military blimp they use to move objects too large to be moved on the streets however there are documented reports since the 1940s of this exact craft. To this day i am still shaken by what happened wanting to see it again however scared to death that i will. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

268,Sat stationary in the sky for over 15 minutes. It did not get bigger or smaller and did not move until it moved very fast at a 45-50 degrees into the water.
269,A single bright white orb as bright as a plane with landing lights. When I first noticed it it seemed to be shooting down from right to left like a falling star but abruptly changed direction upwards and then to the other side almost in a triangle formation. Incredibly bright and faster than I ever could have imagined.
270,was working on a drilling rig(Im a scientist-a geologist) and a total skeptic was picking up supplies in Clinton OK.  Driving back to the rig west of Elk City OK. between 5 18-wheelers saw it in the distance moving back and forth possibly near the old Air Force Base then it was beside us following us couldnt stop because i was sandwiched betwwen the trucks it followed sideways down the interstate had 3 large lights in a triangle couldnt see the true shape it was 1:00 AM but could see the skin it was organic looking and not flat but shaped in swirls was in the military know what aircraft skin looks like we all speeded up and got out of Dodge City kinda suprised no one has reported this before.
271,I was 3-4 years old  am 51 now..this is a description of only one of the sightings I witnessed in Hillsboro  N.H. in the early 60’s. I have reason to believe that I was not the only one who was witness to this. I am seeking others who were in Hillsboro  N.H. in the early 60’s This sighting occurred in the Summer in the middle of the night. The ship i saw was parked above the Y intersection of Henniker St. and Jackson St. The ship was huge and just hung in the air. the underneath was not a smooth surface but seemed to have a look like the underside of a car..i could see shapes and shadows and the colored lights were in this area. The entire street area was lit up with a yellow light but I could not see the source of this light. There is much more i could share about this sighting but you know  don’t want to appear “crazy”. A funny aside..in my family we called heaven cloud 9..as a small child this is how i identified what i saw..”oh  it’s cloud nine” If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

272,While stuck in traffic on the High St. in Oxford  headed to London  around mid afternoon  I witnessed a large silver ball at 2:00 O’clock position.  Thinking that was odd because the moon should of been behind me. When looking back in the direction for the moon  it was where I thought it should be.  When returning in the direction of the UFO it was still stationary brefly then disappered in the matter of mill seconds. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

273,was looking out bedroom window saw object.didnt believe it ran to son and daughter in law went onto porch and asked them to look my son said i am not seeing this.we told him yes you are.object dissapeared behind trees.turns out boyfriend has senn these on more than one occasion over the last 15 years.he has never said anything because he knew we would all call him crazy.well i guess we all are crazy cause we saw it.
274,ok  so my girlfriend and I were up all night on sunday watching the meteor shower.  Around 2:30 we noticed about 20 lights over the ocean kind of with this wabble that identified them as multiple objects.   THey moved fairly slowly inland and over palos verdes and vanished into the clouds over the hill.  Now what we saw next was completely different.  They looked like planes but they were silent and they were low enough to see without any lights.   Only the reflection of any lights from the ground lit the object to make it visible to be seen.  Once again they were VERY low and there were 3 in a triangle formation.  They were wabbling while in flight and went from hermosa to once again palos verdes within 10 seconds.   Completely silent with a low almost silent ocean tide.  This incident occurred around 3:00 am. Ok so the crazy thing is now my girl and I have sit on the roof for the past 5 nights for a couple of hours just kind of observing and 4 OUT OF 5 NIGHTS  WE’VE SEEN THE SAME OBJECTS!!!!!!!  THE way these objects move in the air space is what makes my stomach knot up.   THey seem o be weightless and like pulled from a string.  But They are not remote control not models in the sky.  Some travel over palos verdes in seconds and others take their time.  Some travel in a uniform straight line while others perform flipping maneuvers and kind of spazzing out.   I’m am almost 100% certain that ANY NIGHT OF THE WEEK IF YOU SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS OBSERVING YOU WILL SEE THESE OBJECTS OVER HERMOSA BEACH.  LAST night there were 17 my girl and I counted.  I said to her I swear to god if we see a group of these things I’m gonna flip out.   Within an hour unlit clusters of round objects were flying directly over our heads and  once again some were uniform and some appeared to be “messing around” in flight.  These were all headed it seemed straight for Catalina.
275,I looked up and thought Oh cool a satellite then it looked like it started shake and moved through the sky at a very fast pace i lost track of it and went inside
276,My wife and 30yr old son were marveling at the bright redish full moon that was just coming over the ocean edge   and we noticed a redish  star/planet just north on the moon at a very low altitude .  But it was growing in size and getting larger and brighter all the time   it came within 1 500 ft at an altitude of less than 100+-ft. Came to the ocean edge and then came north a couple hundred yards  closer to our ocean front house.  I grabbed my binoculars and I could see the exact shape and some very small flames underneath the unit.  Then without sound or without turning it went straight east until it went out of site { 5 minute max. the entire episode was completed} My wife tried to get a photo   but it went away too quickly.
277,At approximately 10:30 PM April 4th  2013 we were at Pismo State Beach Park  Pismo Beach CA. While sitting at our camp site we looked towards the North and saw a very bright orange starry object flying south. There were no engine sounds nor were there normal red  white or blue aircraft running lites. It was obvious at this time that it wasn’t a normal aircraft in which were accustomed to seeing. It traveled north and when it was just past us it stopped and hovered for about 30 seconds. It then slowly rose upward until i dissappeared. On April 5th  2013 at approximately 8:45 PM. The same type craft traveled from north to south in the same location. This time the aircraft continued traveling south. There was no hovering this time. There were five sperate sightings that occurred in10 minutes.  Four aircraft had identical routes south and the last one traveled south  south east.

278,as per my comment on your blog  I thought I was seeing things until my husband asked me if I had seen what he saw If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: lorideluca@verizon.net
279,object stayed suspended in the sky before moving in a shaky zig zag motion.Object in the sky would get very bright white then dull down to almost being unseen before brighting back up.The object then moved very fast to the west and disappeared.

280,Walked dog in evening (dark) down our street  which faces toward Southpoint (HI) and overlooks the ocean.  Saw bright green (green center with lighter outside) circular shape above streetlight (just about same size as streetlight) but since there is nothing around other than sky and ocean in that direction it could not have been another streetlight or vehicle.   I saw it appear once and disappear instantly and then show up again within microseconds below original place of sighting but not quite as bright and then it was gone.  These facts  the way it appeared and disappeared  make me believe that is was not an airplane or a meteor.  For an airplane  the light did not flash on and off for longer period of time/going along a particular flightpath plus it was much too large  and for a meteor it did not appear long enough.

281,this thing just came from no were  as my brothers and i sat outside his house this bright red light just was cruisin by in a horizontal pattern then stopped and went up until it disappeared into the sky all while not making one noise  and the light was not flashing it was just bright red If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

282,looking northeast  just after 6pm  I noticed a funny colored light in the sky. first I thought it was a plane coming in to Lebanon Airport.  the color was odd  but I thought  with the amount of moisture in the air  it is being tinted orangeish.  as I watched the light  it dimmed out as another light began to glow on.  it looked like the “plane” was turning and banking towards the left. but  then it happened again.  as this second light dimmed  another light came “on”.  this was no plane. as I watched  it happened again.  and again  and again.  as one light dimmed out  another began to lite up.   they were “on” for about 20  seconds before dimming.  they  were in a straight line.  approximately 20 degrees from horizon line.  also low to horizon line   just above the hills they didn’t drop or waver.  Just stayed in place for the duration of each being lit.    this happened 6 or 7 times.  I grabbed one of my co-workers to make sure I wasn’t seeing things.  He saw it too.  there was no noise at all    a small plane flew overhead  just coming out of the airport.   it flew off towards the west as this was happening.  after it was gone  the last of the lights dimmed out.  It was dark  so I couldn’t see a craft.  just the lights.  But whatever it was  it must’ve been huge.  the lights were quite far apart from each other.
283,I saw it cone down from the sky and hover over my house. It was dusk. I ran to get my neighbor because nobody was home  I was 13 years old. We both stood out on our front yards in amazement.  It hovered for about 5 minutes and then shot straight up in an instant  and it was out of sight.  We stood under it and watched the different colors of light link before it took off. I called the police and made a report. I found out later that there were many other reporting of the same thing that night.  My parents did not believe me and told me not to talk about it. They wished I hadn’t called the police. My neighbor was known as an alcoholic so no one believed her. She wasn’t drunk that night. We were outcasts in the neighborhood after that.
284,Headed home from casino 3 of us in car. Friend named mike in the backseat noticed something coming at us at a high rate of speed. The object hovered right over the top of our car.  My boyfriend was driving  he decided to pull over and him and mikey got out of the car to get a better look. The lights on the bottom of this craft were so bright but they didn’t hurt your eyes.  The craft hovered us for about 2 min then took of to the west. hovered a mountain for a sec disappeared then re appeared in the same spot then took off to the west and never too see it again.

285,I was standing at an intersection waiting to cross the street in downtown Springfield MA with a handful of other people.  Above the Memorial Ave bridge appeared from the cloud cover a geometrical pattern of lime-green lights that hovered horizontally for approx. 30 sec. then moved very quickly vetically into the clouds.   The local newspaper reported that the police dept. had numerous calls of UFO sightings that evening.  Those whom I was standing with all saw it.  If it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t have beleived my eyes.  Its been so long that I don’t remember the exact date  but the Springfield Republican newspaper archives will show the exact date.  Pretty cool experience.  I don’t think that it could have been made by humans.  If we had that technology back in the 80’s all of our current problems would’ve been solved by now IMHO.

286,shiney ball appeared then  disappeared like 5/10 second period ! If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: villagecarpenterz@aol.com
287,Once objects got about 1/4 mile high the object located to the right of the other object moved in front of the other object and they both moved in usision as if the now first object was pulling the second object.   I watched until they disapeared over a hill to the east. The objects made no sound and remained bright throughout the entire time I watched them. The time was aproximately 4:45 Saturday morning.
288,Daniel captures the spectacular fleet of UFOs in South Gate  California  on January 30  2017. This batch of UFOs compliments an actual flying saucer he filmed last week. The fleet was captured in his backyard at 9:59am with his Nikon P900.  Daniel just looked up in the sky and saw a 2 inch cluster array of white orbs. He immediately ran into his house  grabbed his camera and tripod and began to fill this incredible sight. This one is for the history books.  Notice how the orbs maintained an equidistance from each other except for one  possibly the commander that moved among them. This one is a sight to behold. Don’t deny or dismiss what is obvious to see.
289,Vehicle was stopped over rr. tracks on bash rd. just north of U.S.52. 2 brite white lights on front  1 red on west wing  1 green on east wing. It was very dark that night but it was triangular in shape.  I got out of my vehicle and looked and it started to move northwest very slowly. It made a noise similar to an electric motor pump. This happened almost 3 months ago and is still on my mind.
290,A orange light just came from no where  then 2nd came just to the lower right  than a 3rd appeared under the first one.  Looked like a triange affect.  No noise  appeared at 6:25 pm and disappeared at 6:32 pm. One appeared than second and than third.  First one  when it aisappeared just faded into itself then the 2nd did the same and then 3rd.  Strangest think I ever saw.  No planes were in the sky.
291,At first there was one object traveling north in the sky. We wached it for about 10 seconds when another object the same size and color appeared to drop out of the bottom and move downword for a few seconds and then disappear. The original object continued to move at a steady pace and then it disappeared too! Whatever it was  it was awsome. Seen by 4 people.
292,the lights moved around each other. then as fast as they were there  they were gone.  The air force came out that night and for the next two nights.  And there was nothing more then that.
293,box-shaped with a kind of turret on one side If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: janicel.0327@inbox.com
294,there was two flashing silver lights.became one. hovered of a building. for a minute or so .a blue light came on . rose above the building and then flew for a few seonds  then disappered  no noise.
295,My husband and I were also out with our daughter tonight to get ice cream. When we walked to the car I noticed what I thought was Venus. Only because I know a few planets can be seen in the sky this month. The star was still very bright and visible when we got back home.  While standing there admiring it  it just blinked out. I had to asked my husband if he just saw what I saw. I looked back in time to see it reappear  we both stood there not really sure of what we had just seen.  After a few minutes of it doing the this light show of dimming then getting really  REALLY bright we notice it was moving. jumped back in the car and tried to follow but we lost it behind some trees. It had just disappeared.
296,My fiance and I were going for a night walk to get the baby to sleep and when I walked out the door we seen a dull big red glow in the eastern sky and I thought it was mars and he said it was a star.  We walked closer to the school and he said it had moved so I looked and it started moving very slowly then all of a sudden it jets at a 90 degree turn northwest toward Terre Haute  Indiana within for to five mintues of it moving it disappeared immediatly.  Within seconds of it dissappearing flying objects came in circling the area that looked like airplanes but there was no red or blue lights flashing on them. They had long wings that stuck out like an airplane but the only lights that were on them were white and on the back of the wings and they flash fast like strobe lights.  Four or five of them showed up and circled the area for around 15 minutes and flew away like an airplane but without an engine sound. Five to ten minutes after they left more of the round orange red lights showed up flying out of the west into the northeast toward indianpolis these seemed to appear out of nowhere and hover for just a second then jet out of sight within 20 seconds on the first three or four that came through.  OVer the course of the next forty to forty five minutes the exact same looking ones would appear from nowhere like the first four but the did not stop and take off and the lights shut off for a second them come back on and it repeated about 3 times.  We seen one in the Eastern sky that had a orangish spotlight that came on then shut off within a few seconds and was heading toward Indianapolis then dissapeared. Two to three minutes after that one appeared they started coming from the west heading to Indy again. I am unsure on the time frame of this and we counted at least 30 heading that way in three to five minute intervals. They too would shut their lights on and off.  After all this happened we seen no more and within fifteen minutes after the last one we seen we seen three stealth fighters heading east they were extremely loud and moving fast toward indy. Two went through and disappeared over the horizon. The last one came through slow and as he got farther over our town an orange light appeared beneath him he quickly accelerated and went into a nose dive towards it.  The orange light took a 90 degree turn towards the south and the took a 90 degree turn upwards and within 20 seconds it had disappeared and the stealth had lost it. the jet recorrected his altitude he was at before and accelerated hard northeast towards indianapolis and then that was the end of that one.
297,We were outside looking at the stars when we noticed a very large bright “star”. The object started moving at a slow constant speed about halfway across the sky. Then while still moving the object started to dim until we could barely see it.  The object then stopped for approximately one minute  then continued to move at a fast pase until it disapeared behind a tree.  We then lost track of the object.

298,My family and I were staying at the Languna Keys at N. Myrtle Beach the week of the 21st July 2010.  At 9:25 PM looking out our Ocean front Condo I spotted a small glowing red-orange ball of light appear and grow in size.  Itwas totally still over the ocean. I estimate aroung 5K feet at about the 9 o’clock position looking at the moon.   Immediately another ball appeared adjacent to it but a little lower but the same size.  Then another ball appear in the upper left side slightly above both balls.  The two outter balls quickly exchanged places and then all blinked off in 2 separate series.   Then all of a sudden they disappeared as if someone turned a light switch off.  Amazing.  I looked at my watch and it was 9:25 PM; the whole event took maybe 15=20 seconds.   There was no sound and no air traffic in the area during the whole event.  I was glad to read someone else witnessed this… this was my first ever seeing anything of this nature.
299,Just got back from Myrtle Beach.  My husband and I saw 2 UFOs just after sunset last Monday  July 19th.  We were staying at the Marriott Grand Dunes Resort in N. Myrtle Beach.   We first saw one UFO approx. 4-5 miles out over the ocean; I would place the altitude at about 10 000 ft.  The first one ‘winked’ on  and then immediately another one appeared to the right of the first one.   The second one had 4 round lights in a horizontal line.  I would describe the color of both as being orange.  Both crafts were hovering in the air and did not move.  After a few seconds  the one on the right ‘winked’ out  followed by the one on the left.   We watched for about 20 more minutes  but did not see them again.  It was not fireworks  not a plane  and not a reflection off the sun  as it was well below the horizon behind us at that time.  We were very skeptical of what we saw  but could not come up with a reasonable explanation.   It is very interesting that there were at least 2 other sightings last week.
300,I saw two of the disc shapes with bright white lights in the sky that same night in East Mesa  AZ.  One of the discs to the East & one to the North.   The sporadic bright white lights moved in a circular pattern on the outside to form a circle shape.  Approx. 6 white lights would circle the outside of the object and then would meet in the middle then go back out to the outer edge of the circle and repeat the pattern. I’m not sure if I can describe it correctly  but it had a pattern to it.    I wouldn’t have believed it if my parents hadn’t seen it too.  If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes I would have never believed it.  I’ll never forget what I saw!  I wish I would have thought to take a video of it.
301,I was driving down orange ave. when i saw a triangle of three red lights  at first i thought this was a radio or cell phone tower. Then i looked and remembered that there isn’t any between orange ave and  narcoossee road.  I watched the object slowly spin moving east intell it was out of site. This object move to slow to be a plane and was not a helicopter.I have not seen anything like this before this or to this day
302,I am also in Surprise  AZ and I believe a saw one last night  around 8:30PM. I was in the pool with my wife and we were looking at the sky and saw an object traveling much higher and much faster than a plane. It was a bright light and it kept going  and going  until it came to a stop for a few seconds  then it changed directions and it disappeared.
303,We saw the same thing last night  June 22  2010  over Chesterton  Indiana.  It was a diamond shape  almost looked like it was on fire or glowing.  it went over the cornfield behind us and then just disappeared.   about three minutes later  same thing.  exact same path.  We thought it could be fireworks  but it was too high up  no sound.
304,I personally did not have a sighting I did however hear an extremely loud BOOM. Terrified I only look out the windows. I called My husband who was a work on the south end of kokomo. He said he saw something huge in the sky that ha three lights like a triangler shape.  He saw it’s lights come on one at a time then go off in the same order as they turned on. He kept watching and said it completely dissapeared for a few seconds then re-appeared as if t had raised up a bit higher and faced the opposite dirrection.  Once again the bright white lights came on one at tie and went off in the same dirrection. My husband said he saw this the NIGHT BEFORE the BOOM. Some time after this (not sure exactlly  when or how long after) my husband an i went outside and was admiring the sky when we saw three huge rings in the sky that lookeed like we could reach up and touch them. I do not know if this could be related or not and i do not know if anyone else has seen these rings.
305,At about 8:15PM I had gone to the convenience store nearby  and was returning home  so that would make 8:30 the time of the sighting. My fiancee had come outside to meet me. He looks up and says  “What the hell is that?” so I looked up.  It was a red light traveling towards the north. I thought maybe it was a plane. He said  “No  that’s no plane. I know every plane used by the military and civilians  and that’s not a plane.” And I guess he would  since he is a retired Green Beret  and trained for his pilot’s licence when he was younger.  It made no sound that we could hear  and the light did not blink as aircrafts do. We watched it for about 2 minutes when we started to hear something. He said  “Now that sounds like a jet.” Soon we could see another aircraft  which he identified as an F15  approaching the UFO.  The UFO turned and came towards us  which would have been east. After about a minute  we could see that the UFO was shaped like a triangle. We could hear the jet screaming trying to catch it  and the UFO seemed to be playing with the jet. It (the UFO) would slow down  let the jet almost catch up  then speed back up.  The UFO  with the jet following  moved in a wide clockwise circle  and we watched it for about 10 minutes before it and the jet both moved east towards the ocean out of sight. This is the first report we have made of the incident  our rationalization being that obviously the military knew it was there  as they put a chaser on it.  Plus  I really don’t want to be known as “the crazy UFO couple”. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: sandrine76@live.com
306,
307,I also saw a ufo in summer 72.at Arrow Highway and Geneva  st.over the resevoir north of wheeler park at vista del valle school. this area just west of indian hill ..it was hoevering over the resevoir and my best freind mike and i both saw it and ran.it was shaped like a greyhound bus.it had headlightes on the fron and we saw a red light hanging from a drop cord get sucked back into it it moved away from the reservoir area and right over us and three houses south headed west.
308,
309,saw my friend returning from a vacation outside living room window. I was 6 yrs old.I ran outside to run up the street to see my friend  When I was outside on my front lawn ALL TIME STOPPED and absolutely silent.Not even a tree leaf moved.  I then saw a man-like figure decending from the sky about 40-60ft in length.It was illuminating and was part solid and part liquid in look.it appeared to be fuzzy in view around the edges. It then went behind a house up the street. The very moment I lost sight of it I was again in the living room of the house again My friend and his family then drove by again.Time stopped awhile I sighted this and then time repeated itself with the same events but minus the ufo.  In 1992 I saw a book and seen similar sightins in the usa about the same time as mine. I was shocked. The only difference was how time appeared to stop during my sighting and I ended up back in my house not knowing how I got there. I have never reported this other than to my wife.I was 6 yrs old and now I am 43 If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: rick035f@yahoo.com

312,looked like the sun but white and smaller and closer with a silver and red and blue strobe. It jiggled from side to side and backward and forward  like it got bigger then smaller. Have video.
313,I was 9 years old and I was sitting on the steps of my friend’s house in the evening (it was dark.) I looked up and saw a silver disc come from behind  and I watched it shoot across the sky toward the horizon. It was a dull silver color. It was dull-bright  like a dull full moon. I could tell it was a solid object. It was the size of a nickel held at arm’s length. It was scared  but I watched in awe.
314,Definitely metallic  no sound  no lights and no sign of wings. This was viewed by me and seven others while cruising Lake Zoar.
315,I saw two white objects flying in a SW direction very slowly  and got my binoculars and as I tried to focus on them they seemed brighter in the sunlight. I thought they were ballons at first  but then one went in the oppisite direction it was going. I then looked with my own eyes and couldn’t seem them  and then looked back through the binoculars  but they were gone.
316,I don’t know but it was just after the Monsanto Plant dumped molten slag from there fertilization plant which is a bi product. So it lights up the sky. I looked out side because of this and above S Hill.  There it was a huge circular object. I cannot to this day tell you what it was but it was there then after 3 minutes or so. It streaked across the next mountain range.  I have never documented this with anyone  but it doesn’t matter I seen what I seen it was UFO. I tried to find a camera but no luck.

317,I went outside a few days ago at around 5 A.M. at my house in Pineville  LA and I saw what I thought was a funny looking star. It was orange and it was stationary for about 30 seconds or so. I kept looking at it because it looked a lot bigger and brighter than the stars and it was really bright and orange  and then it started moving up and pulsing a pink light and flew past my house slowly with no sound. Very strange.
318,I have spent two days searching for a link to what I saw early Sunday morning  I got home later from working Saturday night and was watching a little TV to relax.  Something bright caught my attention out of the corner of my eye so I got up and went to the window and I saw a very bright Orange object traveling from right to left across the sky line. Your description is almost as if were saw the same thing but I live in Moscow Russia and the time best guess was about 3am  15 minutes I believe after your sighting. If you find out what it was please let me know  but what ever it was went right over Moscow center traveling NW *[There is a sighting titled “Buckley  Flintshire  Wales  UK; April 3  2010”  from which this was a comment on.]
319,We saw 5 bright orange lights at 8:35 pm on 4-4-10.  First 3  then 4th  ran outside to look and 5th appeared traveling from west to east slowly. Looked for first 3 and they had disappeared. The 5th one seemed to catch up to the 4th and blended together before shooting off in NE direction. There was no sound that we could hear.

THE PERSON I WAS WITH SAW THEM  BETTER .HE SAID THEY HAD RED AND YELLOW LIGHTS COMING FROM THEM . WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE ..THEY WENT IN A STRAIGHT LINE.
322,I walked outside to have a cigarette  behind a line of trees in my backyard  an entire cloud lit up extremely bright blue for about one second. There was nothing behind my house that could have shot the light up from the ground. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: Rivkees@hartford.edu
323,i was driving to pick up a friend for work that night. when i notices something flying low i looked up and saw a huge triangle shape aircraft tilted downward while traveling.  it had 6 circle lights under it place even on the bottom of the aircraft  from what i saw alot of people slowed down to look too. it made no noise i even pulled over. and from my perspective it looked hollow in the middle. it was shaped like 2 triangles together (one big triangle) it looked grey ish or a light black  i couldnt believe my eyes but what was weirder was the tip in front of the aircraft was tipped slightly down  after  i pulled over i couldnt belive what i saw next when it got over the bay it looked like it was flippin forward and then would lock back in to place after it rotated.

324,Seen object in Anaheim  Ca off of La Palma/Gilbert as we were coming down overpass. It first appeared as a streetlight but then I realized that it couldn t be due to being higher up (about 3 Palm trees up in height).  It was hovering over residential area and we drove under the light when it began to move then being able to see it through our sun roof. I was about 5 houses away to getting home so I was able to catch some video with my camera. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: fochoa81@msn.com
325,As I walked out of my upstairs apt.  i what I first believed to be a plane with two flashing lights at the end along with two lights in between in a straigt line. I then got into my car and started to drive towards the light that seemed to be over the mountains in troy  ny.  The obje ct moved east to west as if flying to albany  international airport. I then called my girlfriend as i pulled over to watch the object. I had told her that there was a LOW flying object that i thought was a helicopter  but there was no sound.  She told me to take a picture with my phone but i was not able  the object moved lower than airplanes over 787 towards watervliet ny. After explaining to my girlfriend about the lights she dismissed it as an airplane and i did not speak of iet until…..A few days later we were at a family get together after the funeral of a great man Mickie Potyrala.  A friend of mine was there and also witnessed the object around 8pm. The that i witnessed the object was 8:18pm.He described the object as a one story house over the tree line of troy ny. (hovering).  The only reason he descri bed it as a one story house is because of the lights in a line  but he could not explain the blinking lights at the end. Well we both dismissed the sighting until we collaborated. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: localx0126@yahoo.com
326,I saw a spaceship in Utah on march 12 2010 at 2:15 am it stop right in front of me for like 7 seconds then shatterd in the sky in like 10 pieces no lie plus 3 weeks after i discoverd some kind of thing inside my leg that my body just rejected and came out it was like a real big nerd candy really weird i still have a scar  also wen i left vegas it was 5:00 pm non stop to salt lake and wen i saw that spaceship time kinda froze i had the butterflies i really had to trow up but at the same time i was amaze !! anyway i dont really like typing so i guess this is it anyway if anyone saw the same thing or believe something let me know jonnestud@hotmail.com thanks
327,I was just coming back from having dinner with my friend when we saw these objects moving very quickly eastward.  There was no sound  they moved much faster than a plane and we lost sight of them over the mountains.   It looked like two orbs flying together..but could have been connected because they flew as if they were  like one never hung back or anythng  never varied speed.  It was a brief sighting but pretty clear.  I can’t think of anything I know of that it could have been.  Anyway  email me if you saw it too or have any idea what it was. Thanks. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: kalari_ck@yahoo.com
328,my friend & i were traveling south on I75. she was driving & woke me when she saw the ufo  she saw a bright purple light that flashed like taking a picture.  i continued to watch it  since she was driving. i saw the bright purple light also and it flashed just like it did with her. by this time i was hanging out the window to see where it was going.  it was heading west over the trees  then all at once it just shot straight up in the sky and was gone. since then we have been having weird things happening with us.  we are seeing things that are not there  but the strange thing is we are both seeing the same things. she is still seeing things today  but sees more stuff when she is outside.  i have been seeing things today also  and it is more stuff outside. my friend feels drained  and also has a bruise like fingerprints on her right ankle  3 fingerprints!  i have a cut and places like fingernails dug in my skin on my left foot and ankle. i feel like i am hungover  everything seems fuzzy. we neither one drink or do drugs  we are just confused and a little scared.
329,While doing time in Enfield min. security prison in the mid seventys working as an over night watch in the dairy i observed many times triangle shaped objects in the sky over the fields where the cows grazed. i actually saw above me one triagle shaped object in the sky hoovering while one other triagle shaped object flew silently towards it and then met together to just take off into the sky.many times i saw balls flying past me at night. this i believe was some sort of observation device. ( i guess).  A guard  officer smith saw these things along with me. He once told me not to say anything because the higher ups in the office might think that we were crazy.let me tell you that these things really happened .Believe me i know that there are visitors from someplace . I just dont know where they come from.
330,I was about 6 years old at the time of this event  and for many years could not understand it  and when I did I choose not to talk much about it  I only mentioned it to a few people. Anyway here goes how everything happened to me.  It was the summer of 1985  I was inside the appartment I lived in at the time with my family when suddenly I felt compelled to go outside to the balcony. As I arrived the balcony of my room I looked around and down (this is a 4 stories building and I lived on the topmost one) and saw nothing unusual  but I started to ear a humming noise comming from above and looked up  at this moment I saw what I believed for years to be an helicopter or an airplane. The object itself was either circular or eliptical (as I could only see the border that was not blocked by the top of the building) this circular “Helicopter” had lights around it all over and was colored a grayish silver.  This object was hovering just about 5 meters above myself  just above the building I was in. Then I returned home and the only thing I recall is a image like seeing an old TV not tuned to any channel just showing static and garbage  like when an air broadcast stops  I suppose I blacked out then as I can’t recall anything further that day… Years after after I started studying and reading a lot of books this particular event came back to my memory as I could no longer explain it as an Helicopter or Airplane in the light of my recently acquired knowledge and got to the conclusion that what I saw was actually an UFO for what ever may be accountable for. This particular event deeply influenced my future as it inspired my deep interest in science and made me investigate all I could about the subject  only to get to the conclusion that no known man made object could have possibly be hovering so quietly above myself on that date or even in the present to what matters…  This event has influenced even the rest of my childhood plays as I started playing of making radio-like communication devices and playing of chatting with foreign entities  not necessarily alien. This lead to my interest in computers  which as been very much fruitful since my 11 years old  the time I actually built my first computer. I have ever since worked in IT and my passion for IT and General Science as only increased along the years. NOBODY HAS EVER HONESTLY BELIEVED IN ME OR SHOWED INTEREST IN INVESTIGATING FURTHER THIS EVENTS  Today I actually found a video on youtube that actually has a precise description that matches the object that I’ve seen and curiously enough it has also been described in Portugal around the 80’s (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG4iUPvWEiQ)  Anyone who wishes to debate SCIENTIFICALLY and with a logic ground this matters is welcome to mail me.

332,Just yesterday me and my family say a orange colored light in the sky that did the same thing. It was slowly moving across the sky then about 5 minutes later it just faded away.  The lights didnt blink or anything. Almost like a burning orb in the sky that moved around then went out… Werird..  THis was in Johnsonburg PA
333,I’ve witnessed a ufo in south west Philadelphia on 55 Kingsessing Ave. It was the size of a football field. The color was grey & it had the 3 brightest lights i’ve ever seen in my life!!!  As i was looking at it i couldn’t move or talk. It felt like i wad being controlled. I could see windows and this weird zigzag outline above the windows. The spaceship was 1 mile high and i was right under it
334,I saw 12 – 15 star sized  alittle bigger  going  from one edge of the sky to the opposite edge of the the sky  in seconds … not all at the same time but some by one  twos  and threes. Seemed to be a moving white light but when they would pass right over me the light seemed to fade and would then look like a metal  ball like object. I saw most of them head towards the North East I believe  although some went North and some went South.  I saw one go from the North edge of the sky  travelled 3/4 of the way to the South edge of the sky  then one came all the way from the North end  part of the sky and it caught up to the one heading to the South edge… I mean it hauled ass! They looked like they infused together and what I saw looked like a redish/white light  with a kind of blur look as they came together and then they disappeared! It’s hard to tell though because they were small and so far off from me by this time .  What were all of these object passing over so quickly? All went to and fro basically straight lined. I saw one move up from its center positioning and then moved back to the center  then went down and then again went back to its original position  then moved to the side and and moved again to its original position  then moved to the other side and again went back to its original center position…. it rested in the position it started from and didn’t move again.  Seemed to me like it was signaling these other two UFOs  ones that were approaching from all the way across the opposite side of the sky… the two went directly to it in seconds!  The time was approximately between 11:00pm and 11:50pm on September 16  2009  over Wasilla  Alaska’s nightime sky.  I will be watching tonight for sure! Pretty crazy….Your time and my time are not the same but we did see something on the same night! Very Interesting! If I see more tonight I will post again the following day.

335,My daughter and I were coming home from the store one evening around 8:30-9 and pulled into our drive. As we got closer to the house we observed 3 huge  very bright lights hovering above our house.  We sat in the car for a few moments speechless before getting out of the car and going inside to get my husband. When we returned outside the lights had moved west of us into the neighbors trees.  We were only able to see 1 light in the trees but my husband also observed the light. I don’t know what we seen that night but I would be lying if I said we did not still talk about it and wonder. This is not my first “UFO” experience  so I often wonder why I have had more than one and other people can go a lifetime and never see anything.  I really don’t believe in little green men but what is it? I just can’t stand not knowing.
336,We were driving into Altoona on 17th street when I looked up and above the mountain I saw a bright light moving very slowly  a little slower than an airplane.   The light traveled east along Brush Mountain. I watched it for around 2 minutes until it got a little farther away and then it began to fade darker until it dissappeared instantly.  I continued to watch where it was at but never saw it again.   there were no clouds in the area it was at and i could easily see other stars that were nowhere near as bright as it. It wasno airplane or helicopter because the light was completely steady and constant  it did not blink or flash at all. The only other thing it could have been was a meteor or a comet moving very slowly. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: junge624@aol.com
337,I was reading in the library and witnessed a large aircraft that was clearly a UFO. Later it was circling in a perfectly symmetrical pattern incapable of modern aircraft. It was not a helicopter  I saw. Honestly.
338,I believe around fall of 2007 coming over Diamond Hill Meriden  CT me and my former husband saw a UFO warp out of the atmosphere. This was at the top of Hill view going towards the airport. We have the phenomenon occasionally in this area.
339,it ways september 1987  i was traveling from stratford into bpt..i was between exit 29 n 28  it was after 9pm oclook..i saw on my driver side a big round object going over the highway  it way a ufo..i dont care what poeple said  if they belived or not i do…it was big..i got off the next exit   on got back on the highways n that was ti ….it was gone…then i weat home n told my wife n family…at 10pm i put the news channel n the said poeple was calling about a object looking like a ufo…that my real story…look at that year n you will find imformation …
340,I was driving into work tonight and I saw a similar UFO! I was travelling North on 121 at approx 9:30 PM heading from Fort Worth to Irving when I saw a green light hovering in the sky which quickly zipped from right to left. It then came to an abrupt stop and then zoomed straight up and disappeared. It was really weird!
341,I grew up in Emmett Idaho.Back in the mid sixties a ufo was seen.Myfather ran out with a shotgun.I have seen a brief bit on it on UFO files but have found nothing else.If your still in emmett maybe check the newspaper archives 64-68
342,sitting in my living room  looking out the bay window I noticed something streak across the mountain side. It was very bright  white silver light  the front was burning like a shooting star or debris falling from space. It was elongated as it burned  silent  looking like a sparkler  about the size of a helicopter.  The burning tail lighted up what I thought I saw was some kind of structure  that`s why I thought it was a helicopter on fire crashing threw the tree line. It also seemed to be leaving debris as it went along.  I jumped up and ran outside of my front deck to see the crash or hear it crash  but nothing. No crash or sound  it just vanished. It was flying very low  the falling stars that I have seen are very high and burn up way before the mountains or tree line.  Has anyone in the Sullivan County New York area reported anything like a shooting star ?  The whole incident lasted about minute. Will keep checking here to see if anyone else has seen anything  thanks.
343,UFO WAS REPORTED 3:45 PM NOVEMBER 9  2010 OVER PISMO BEACH NEAR DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
344,Group of 5 divers witnessed right around sunset all sat in total silence as the object cane in from a high western altitude hovered over a single spot over the ocean having a green haze that descended in a triangular shape to the ocean object hovered about 2-5 min then Hit a 45 degree angle to the NW and disapeared into the sky.  The green triangular haze that came from the craft to the ocean stayed visible for a good 10 minutes after the craft disappeared. I contacted the coast guard and was told it was a rocket test. No way a rocket does what we witnessed.
345,I was not the only one that seen these crafts  two other people came over to my house telling about these things in the sky(UFO)went outside and I seen three at first and my friend handed me a hand held telescope.  I climb up on a ladder and watched four of these disks shaped with bright lights that changed colors and moved veritical in the sky and one took off like lighting while the others hovered around something.like they were studying something sometimes they would be equal distance apart an other moments one would be a little further north then the others The lights where intense  red   then blue  yellow and white together…I have often wondered if there really was UFO’s .. I don’t wonder anymore.  I know what i saw and it wasn’t weather balloons or planes or any other craft we have. these were not ours………. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: Trapedinarizona@yahoo.com
346,A group of us saw 7 -8 large fire balls that came from the SW direction. The came out 1 at a time slowly. they were in the sky for a good 6-7 minutes.   I have it on video.  Most of them disapeared but one of them we were able to watch.  It seemed almost like the fire stopped and we saw something white-ish floating through the air.   I was thinking it may have been a parachute or a hot air balloon but now I am not so sure.  I wish I could post the video!
347,I saw the object pass close by the window and went out with my partner to the balcony  it was not moving too fast initially and I had time to get the binoculars.   It seemed to become round the further away it got  it picked up speed and disappeared over the sea.  by that stage it looked like a small very dark orange planet. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: jackie.fitzgerald@gmail.com
348,Me and my dad witnessed these 3 shapes around 01:50. One after the other all going in the same direction and travelling at the same speed.  I got a look at them through binoculars  they seemed to be orange in colour with a brighter orange ball at the end of it. It took about five minutes in total for the three shapes to pass through the sky.  They all reached the same part of the sky and disappeared. Its good to know i wasnt the only one to witness this
349,Object hovered in the sky in one location (above Petsmart)for minutes then traveled north about a half mile and hovered (above Maplewood Mall)for 30+ minutes.
350,At 12.00am on the 01/01/10  my wife and i went outside to look at the fireworks in our garden. When we noticed two yellow/orange objects flying across the sky from NNE to SW. One was flying quite low and the other flying slightly above.  They seem to be flying in formation. There was no sound.  Then at this point another came from the same direction and then seem to gain altitude till quite high in the sky. At this point stopped and held its position for about 10 minuets then seem to fade from view.  After this there was another five yellow/orange objects that seam to follow the same path across the sky. They again seem to be in formation.
351,Moved fast and in controlled manner. Witnessed by five of us at the same time. Tracked them from East to West down Galway Bay. Dismissed idea of fireworks. Far too controlled  fast and high – straight flight as if powered and/or guided. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: sylfredcar@iolfree.ie
352,Driving home from work today on Rt 72  going towards Lebanon from Annville.  I thought I seen something unusual in the sky.  It was one bright light.   There were no other lights on it indicating that it was a aircraft of some sort.   It then dimmed as if the light had turned its direction.  As I was trying to figure out what it was  it disappeared.   I then was looking all through the sky to try to find it.  I was about a mile or two down the road when it appeared again.  It was not moving at first  therefore I thought it might have been a star.   But within a few seconds it started moving again.  When I was directly underneath this “moving star”  at a red light   my AM radio station went out.  But as soon as I moved from underneath it  my station came back on.   And keep in mind this is a station that comes in very clear for me.   Of course  within a minute this light then disappeared again.  Not sure what it was  but if anyone knows  please let me know If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: borruto@verizon.net
353,at first i thought someone was racing cars down the road but they were so fast and passing each other back and forth up and down the road at or above the fence top .  they were super sonic fast then they came to a complete halt and slowly faded away.i still cant get over seeing them ive seen demonstration on tv like them they call orbs or something like that.

354,ON DEC 16 AT 7:45 PM I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM RIVERSIDE CA. AS I APPROACHED A CITY CALLED “COLTON” I SAW A UFO HOVERING ABOVE THE 10 FWY BY” LOMA LINDA” CA. IT HAD WHITE ROTATING LIGHTS ON THE SIDE OF IT THAT WERE SPINNING RIGHT TO LEFT. I SAW THE CRAFT TILT SIDEWAYS AND THEN GO BACK TO A LEVEL POSITION. THEN HOVER TO THE LEFT ABOUT 150 YARDS  THEN COME BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SPOT. I CONTACTED 2 POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND THEY HAD NO REPORTS….I FIND THAT UNBELIEVABLE. THE CRAFT ALSO HAD A NON FLASHING RED LIGHT ABOVE IT THAT STAYED ON. I WENT FROM A DOUBTING THOMAS TO A BELIEVER IN SOMETHING NOT OF THIS WORLD. THIS UFO WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE GROUND  ATLEAST COMPARED TO A PLANE….CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT WITH ANY INFO? SINCERELY  BAFFLED AND CURIOUS If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: TVXPUNK@AOL.COM
355,Each object went in a straight line over my house around a mile apart  as one went overhead another seemed to appear.  They were round and looked like balls of orange fire they were so bright they seemed to have lights coming off them making them look almost like trangles (which you can’t see on the video)they were under cloud level.  I got a couple on my video camera and there were 3 other witnesses with me it wasn’t planes as one plane had gone overhead and you could tell the diference they were NOT chinese lanterns and they made no sound and seemed to just get smaller and vanish it was very strange. On my camera i zoom right into two of them and they look a bit like a cell with a nucleus very wierd. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: alyshia474@aol.com
356,Looked to have rose from nowhere in the north from behind the  houses  then proceeded to travel south in a rapid straight line for approx 5mins until i lost sight.  Was totally silent and witnessed by 2 others but only aftr it went over head If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: Molexsx@o2.co.uk
357,long object not sure of shape several lights or burners were whitish red and these lights were only on for 5 to 7 seconds and they would go out slowly.  the lights would appear as if from nowhere and were only visible twice. the object moved after the lights went out and in about 5 to 7 seconds later would reappear and go out.  the object would then be as if it were never there. this object did not have any running lights whatsoever once it was out for the second time there was no trace of it again.  this sighting happened on two nights in a row the first night at 6:40 pm cdt second night at 6:50 3 miles from the first night sighting and on the second night we also saw it in nearly the same spot in the road as the first night.  time between the first sighting and second sighting was about 3 minutes this was on the second night. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: smithy.57@hotmail.com
358,could see outline of object when the light went out
359,it was about 11:30pm on Sunday. My parents saw something in the sky and woke me up. We went to go chase it and we got right under it. It was the most scariest time of my life.
360,Please let me know if anyone else has seen this!! Last night  December 24  2009 at around 12:30 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. I spotted a moving object moving extremely slow in the sky far away with red lights.  I initially thought it was a plane but within seconds it was near the tree tops of the house next to me!  I thought it was some type of hovering box with rotating colors which were initially red and white.  The colors then changed to green as well and maybe blue?  The lights began flashing and it was so close.  Next thing I knew it was far away in the sky.  The objec wrapped round my house in an odd travel path. Again please let me know if anyone else has seen this!! If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: nroyal2@radford.edu
361,Traveling as FAST as anything I have ever seen in the sky…Whooosh Approx. 10 PM.  White bright ball of light with a purpose traveling across the sky  almost three miles above my head.  This thing came up behind my condo heading West to East..It woould have crossed GA400 between Morgan Falls and Spaulding.  WOW…thought I was in a movie.
362,saw white streak. May have been a meteorite. Appeared to be moving too fast for commercial plane
363,from the bottom. white  with brown marks in the shape of flames. no sound.it was moving from sw to the ne  stopped suddenly  hovered 3 to 4 sec. driffed n about 5 sec. disapeared. it looked as if it just closed in on itself If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

364,Because this sighting occured like 30 years ago  the details are missing in my recall. I was not alone  my boyfriend at the was with me and he saw it too: a dark  large  triangular object with lights on the bottom side. Not many. Maybe one on each corner and a few across the back.  There was no sound whatsoever. It was low  slow quiet and at a 45 degree angle just above the trees at that angle. it just kept going until the trees blocked our view.We could not believe what we saw! And we KNEW it was a UFO! I have always wanted to know what other people saw. I know someone else had to!
365,CRAFT WAS LOW. AS I WATCHED IT MANUVER WEST AND THEN BANK SOUTHWEST I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMMERCIAL JET THAT WAS GOING DOWN IN THE EVERGLADES.HEADING WEST VIEW FROM REAR CRAFT WAS A “V” SHAPE.  ONCE IT MAINTAINED A STATIONARY POSITION FACING SOUTHWEST FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES SOME PEOPLE STOPPED TO WATCH AS THEN HAD ALSO SEEN CRAFT TWO MILES AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING TO WATCH. MAINTAINING HEIGHT CRAFT WAS VERY SLOWLY MOVING SOUTHWEST.  IF ANYONE ELSE SAW THIS PLEASE POST TO LOG.
366,Upon traveling East on Hwy 89 from Kanab Utah to Page AZ  I first saw what looked like a “shooting star” traveling from North to South.  What stood out to me was that the “star” traveled the entire distance of the sky or horizon  I thought that it was strange for a shooting star to travel so far.  A few moments later another object followed the first one but it stopped in the southern sky  with this two more objects flying together came into view and stayed on the same path as the first object and kept on going South.  The one that had stopped; started to fly back north and all of a sudden out of the North appeared a very large greenish cylinder or “I hate to say it” Cigar shaped object.  The small object joined up with it for a few moments and then took off like a shot and kept on the southern course of the others. The large object kept on it’s Southern track also…  A truck driver in front of me stopped his truck in the road and got out to ask me if I has seen the objects. We were both in shock  it was a very interesting sight to say the least…
367,Standing on my back porch in the dark. Talking to my girlfriend on the cell phone who heard the description as I relayed it to her. (I also called out to my mother who came outside and is also a witness) Looking up at the stars I noticed two “stars” traveling across the star filled sky. One following the other perfectly. Always at the same distance from each other.  They looked very far up. I watched and I looked for blinking lights but there were none. There were airplanes in another part of the sky. They of course had blinking lights (red  blue).  I watched them travel for two minutes as they crossed the sky. The two bright lights crossed past the moon and 15 seconds later turned a rust red color and ascended till they disappeared.
368,I was driving south on the freeway when I spotted this low aircraft. It was so low  and there wasn’t any sound that I could hear. Also  the red lights were rotating for a a few moments.  However  the lights turned off as soon as it was directly over the freeway  but I kept my eye on it’s outline  and they turned on again briefly once it was over a field. Then  the lights turned off again.  I could see the outline was more like a solid triangle. Did anyone else see anything? I saw some cars slow in front of me  but there were not that many people on the road. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: pennylaneishere@live.com
369,There were two of us that saw it. I was 18 and my friend was 60. The object hovered perfectly still in the air and was completly silent. After about five minutes it shot through the atmosphere instantaneously. It never made a sound and it didn’t return.
370,It wasn’t completely dark yet outside.There was still visibility. I couldn’t tell the area taht the ship rose out of. I just saw it as it got above the treetops and rose slightly higher. It was stationary but it spinning very slowly while lights went all the way around the larger saucer part of the ship. At several times it tilted at an angle while spinning and the lights seems to have a sequence pattern. There were also two other colored lights that seemed to come on at certain times.I was driving towards it and could see it clearly. I had recently seem one identical to it in shape but about 1/5 of the size moving slowly over rooftops about 3 weeks ago right after sunset in the Champions area where there are alot of trees in the neighborhood. I followed it as long as I could.
371,Every night from 7pm-11pm my mother and I have witnessed a UFO posing as a bright star and eventually blinks out over the pacific ocean.  It starts off as a very intense bright star around 7pm and thoughout the evening moves very very slowly. It starts off in the east and fades over the pacific before it blinks out.  I began to realize this isn’t a star when I was walking my dog one evening  it was a cloudless summer night in August  it was beautiful to look at the stars and take my dog for a walk.  As i began to walk  I looked up at the bright “star” and it just turned off. I thought that was kind of weird. So when i got home  I sat in my backyard with my mother and told her  as to her dismay she didn’t believe me so i wanted to prove it.  We watched the star and in 17 minutes time  the star began to move. When it moved  it was wobbly. And right before it moves it shoots off a red light into the air.  This happens every night  we are pretty sure this is a training mission or something of the sort for this UFO that eventually keeps moving very slowly and blinks out over the pacific ocean every night.  If you live in newport beach  california look out in the sky around this time for a bright star  it might take roughly 30 minutes for it to move  but you will see this.
372,When I first saw the 4 UFO s they were all split up dancing around whatever planet is in the western sky this time of year. They were flashing green and red quite beautiful before gathering together in two s then started flying slowly in two s towards the southeast over Iowa.

373,Heading East on what was then called Pringle Falls Rd  we were returning to camp after a day of hunting.  Paulina Peak lay directly ahead of us as the sun had just set.  On top of Paulina Peak there was this brillant light.  As we continued toward Newberry Crater  the light headed North off the peak.  One passenger with me interpreted the lights as head lights from a vehicle  since there is a view point up there (in the sixties it was just a very dangerous dirt road to the top).  I disagreed  since the light traveled North from the view point.  If it had been a car  it would have plunged a thousand feet or more off the North facing cliff.  As we were heading East on Pringle Falls Rd  we got close enough to see a shape.  It was like slicing the top off the the US Capitol building  having a spire at the top of the dome shape.  I witnessed two other UFO events in the Springfield OR area in the late 60’s that were probably even more interesting  but I’ll save those for inquires.  I have not experienced any sightings since the sixties. Oh  wait  there were those dark shadows in the night sky when I lived in Wyoming for a short time.

374,Bright white light came streaming into our bedroom window and woke us up. The light blinked on then off and back on again. Then stopped. We got up and looked out the window into the back yard. We saw nothing. However the side of our home was a glow with orange light. My husband went out of the house to observe what was apparantly above the house  but whatever it was vanished. By the time I got out of the house to take a look  the glow had vanished. My husband wanted to report to police  but how do you report something that vanished so fast. The odd part about this is that I now have two objects in my toe that docs cant explain on xray. I know this all sounds odd  but it happened. It has not happened since this incidence.
375,The two headlights remained steady in the sky. I watched them for about two minutes until they slowly disappeared. It looked as though they disappeared because of direction and not lack of illumination. The lights moved in a very mechanical/pivotal way. Looked as though they were hovering.
376,I was in my back yard smoking a cigarette  was looking at the cloud coverage thinking man its nice outside for November.  Then I thought I saw a Shooting star  but as I focused in I saw 6 to 7 lights in a pattern like a half “V” seemed to move at a steady rate then suddenly disappeared.   I got on the internet right away to see if someone else seen this. Im blown away it seemed close  but no sound. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: urgency1@hotmail.com
377,At first when I saw the lights it reminded me of a geese formation when they fly south because there was more lights on one side than the other. I heard no sound and I thought you cant see geese at night and the lights moved perfectly togther. Im not sure what I saw but it was different from anything I have ever seen.
378,It looked like the shape of what a light bulb would look like.  I and 6 others did not see a tail or anything below it.  We used Binoculars and a small Telescope.  In the Telescope it looked like the shape of a perfectly shaped full Karet Diamond and it sparkled like one as well almost like that of a star.   It did appear to have metalic ribs on the top of it.  The light did not go away until it was completly dark.  So unless the sun charged it up to light up It was not a Weather Balloon.  And Besides they had it on the Phonix news just days before we saw it.   And the news station said that they checked to see if anybody owned it if it was a Weather Balloon.  But they said that nobody had claimed it.  The news station was calling it a UFO.  There was even a neighbor that had went up in the air in his private jet.  And he could’nt figure out what it was.  It was bigger than his plane. And up higher than he could get to. Maybe alot more than 5000 ft. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

379,We were outside when we heard a fighter jet fly over. Thought nothing of it until it started banking and circling. At this point we saw the UFO when the jet flew over it.  It was traveling west to east  when the jet flew overhead of it it went south a little bit and hovered  the jet circled again and it moved east to west  hovered for a couple seconds and then shot off at a 45 degree angle and disappeared.  It was the middle of the day and the sky was perfectly clear with no clouds. We would never have seen this object if it weren’t for the fighter jet.
380,It was too dark to see the size of the objects.  But the lights were glowing red  white  blue  purple.   someone else had seen at least 15 in the sky the same evening between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and later.  They could not have been a plane or helicopter.   They were seen in the eastern sky south of the Catalinas.  They remained stationery.
381,this  thing was very big an very loud it was a trangle an had 3 lights on each corner of the points of the craft. this is the second air craft i have seen in this loctaion .the first one was in augst 7 2009 that one was a ball shape small with flames under  moved up an down an hoverd .did not make any noise.

382,About 5.05 PM  from the road near Luray Caverns Airport  looking over New Market gap  I saw a cylinder shaped bright shiny object seemingly reflecting the sunset.  Part of the bottom was covered by a cloud but still visible. It was vertical but slightly tilting. A bright light came out of it like a probe and then went back to it.  I did not see the main object move  it just disappeared. I watched for what it seemed like a few minutes. Many years ago at Christams time  in early seventies  I saw very unusual pulsating lights in the same area.
383,At 7pm I saw a golden “star” off in the distance.  It seemed to hover  thought it was a big bright star at first  and then realized it was moving. It seemed to rise up  then move in slow subtle zig zag movements.   It finally passed by our home after 5 min or so from where I originally saw it   I was able to see what appeared to be nine rectangular shapes  bluish gray in color  there was a white flashing light at the top of the object (although I couldn’t make out what the object was made of)  and there was a small red flashing light directly below these rectangular windows.   It passed by.  10 min. later I saw another golden “star”  got my camera and snapped a few pictures.  This one to seemed to move in subtle zig zag   saw no rectangular shapes  after downloading pictures it appeared the lights moved up and down (though not sure how much was trail from shutter exposure).  Anyway  never saw anything like this. Def. not a plane or helicopter.
384,This bright white object was moving extremely slow with no blinking lights or sounds.   I pointed up and asked a friend if she saw any blinking lights (like on an airplane) or heard any engines.  She replied  “No”.   As soon as it got above me it the object disappeared. The bright light “turned off”.  It was crazy and exciting.  I have seen an UFO when I was younger.  She never did.  She was pretty freaked out.
385,I saw 3 strange objects flying over the sky and three other people also witnessed it. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: wilitoto@hotmail.com
386,I saw a silver round object with a blinking light going very slow towards the South. All the sudden  it stopped… went a little East and dissapeared in the blink of an eye. Clear skies  so it was pretty easy to see.
387,traveling eastbound on I40 around 11pm a bright blue ball (looked like a blue flame) came hurling towards the ground at tremdous speed.  there was no noise and did not see any explosion.  It was too big to be a shooting star and too fast traveling speed
388,I was living in Zonnekus near Woodbridge Island  Milnerton at the time.   One night at around 8.45 pm  I saw a very bright light moving dramatically and erratically in the sky – in the area between Table Mountain and Robben Island.  It must have been there for a number of minutes and it literally shot up and down  then left and right at an incredible speed – – a number of times and then simply disappeared.   It was long enough for me to grab my binoculars and I tried to bring the object closer – to no avail  it stayed exactly the same size.   So it must have been very far away.    It’s had me guessing ever since! I have never seen anything like that before or since.
389,Not a plane or helicopter  not a satellite. Asked a professor he said possibly the ‘Doppler effect’ but I don’t think so. They weren’t planets  and weren’t on any star chart. People in various parts of the state saw them as well. Sometimes they’re in the sky sometimes they aren’t. On the discovery channel  there was a show about UFO’s. At least 4 other states have multiple reports of similar objects. I went to an area with no light pollution and they were ridiculously bright  and you could see them spiraling and spinning.

390,Freaking me out found my binocs and wow  my hisband is in T.O. and I am freaking out wondering if it could be something else and hoping it is.   Went back to check and can not seem to find it.  should I look out my back window from the sencond storey it would be north west.  Should anyone else have seen this please let me know. To far away to take a picture with my sad camera If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: maryjovec@yahoo.com
391,I am not a UFO buff or even interested in UFOs. That is why you might find this interesting.  I am in Durham City  UK and on 5 November 2009 at *about* 9.30pm looked up and saw what *looked like* the flame under a hot air baloon – yellow-orange colour  smaller at the bottom than the top.  If it had been a hot air balloon it would have been at about 1000 ft to have a visible flame this size. It had to be much higher (& therefore massive) though because it was above the thin cloud layer  moving North to South.  Speed across the sky was initially similar to a cruising airliner. Kept watching and EITHER the “flame” size reduced  or the thing speeded up – the latter is more likely because of the position in the sky  assuming it maintained the same altitude.  It changed from large to a dot which persisted in the southern sky for about 5 seconds and then disappeared. No  it was not a Guy Fawkes night firework! I was transfixed on this  not looking around and so did not notice any other similar objects.
392,It was approx. between 12:30a.m.-2:00a.m. in the night not exactly sure of the date but was thru the week last week in April or First week in May 09
393,4 very fast moving objects ufo shaped. after recording it for a while it  vanished!
394,The north star was above the object  and it moved very fast in a horizontal direction  as it glowed a bright orange. There was no sound. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: memememe45@hotmail.com
395,Extremely bright light falling straight down.  Thought it was a meteor but it was straight down.  It was daylight but the sun was starting to set the light was much brighter than the setting sun.  Looked like a prosperous flair falling but it was much too large.
396,All ofos blinked on for a few seconds and then off and then some on and off again. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: mnanceconst@aol.com
397,I was driving south on I-35  roughly between Ft. Worth and Waco.  I noticed a real bright neon green light for about a second or two south/west out my front windshield and then the light streaked across the sky for another two or three seconds….then it was gone. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: sponger@killerfrogs.com
398,they came one after the other bright orange lights an they were travelling in south direction and then withih seconds they dissappeared
399,I was driving home with my boyfriend  and saw it in the windshield  just up from the sunset.   I asked him what it was  and he said it might be Venus.  However  as we got closer  it was obviously not round– It was in the shape of the two pillars I described.   We turned South off of Memorial  and could no longer see the object (it was obscured).  I stopped five minutes later at a friend’s  borrowing a camera  but we could not find it at the time  or when we returned to the spot again about five minutes after that.
400,The sighting lasted for anout 30 sec. It was lights going in a circular pattern with no identifiable aircraft body. Very large circumferance of circular quick rotating lights all same in color with no conus federal regulation lights on craft. It was exciting and weird. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: stormrider50@lycos.com
401,This was a large vehicle of some kind that stood still high in the sky then moved backwards which is why I noticed it. It then came down near 529 from the Green point area bacj towards the Longenbaugh/Huffmeister area.    I pulled over to the side of the road around 9:45 pm and watched it.  It was low to the ground and moving so slowly like it was sightseeing or looking for something carefully.  It made no sound and slowly moved out of my area where I had parked.
402,While at the event Wings over Houston we got there by 1030 am and watch all the event  we had a reserved area by the flight line to watch the Blue Angels who was performing stunts.  Around 15min after they started a group of people who was watching the blue angels perform notice two shiny objects in the sky that were shinning  it was very bright.   There were two that were moving very slow towards the coast  a third one flickered a couple of times like it was letting us know his prescence and the disapear.  A fourth one was very dim and never showed again.  The only two that we took a pic of were there for a least 10-15 min the disapeared. I did some reasearch and found anothner pic from a professional photographer and they are more visible than the pic we took since our camera couldnt pic up that far.

403,It was moving at a steady pace not super fast but not slow either. I watched it for as long as I could before it was obscured by trees. It looked like it was descending and from where I was standing it seemed to be arching slightly towards the North East. If anyone else saw it and took a photo  please send one to me at the address below. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: syrkis@ymail.com
404,We were sitting on the front porch and saw what looked like a helicopter coming toward us. We live near W117th near Bellaire.  I told my husband… “That’s one weird looking helicopter.” Within seconds we noticed it wasn’t a helicopter and was completely silent.  It was glowing very bright orange and appeared to be flickering slightly. It was so bright if there was a craft  we couldn’t make it out.  We only saw the brightness of the light. It traveled approximately 300-400mps across the sky. I walked off the porch to continue watching it and my husband at this point was standing and following it with his eyes.  I kept saying… “what the hell is that??” Why is it so orange? Our minds were racing as we watched it. We were ruling out all types of aircraft.  It was definitely nothing we’ve ever seen before and I’m a sky watcher. I live near a flight path of Hopkins airport  have seen many  many helicopters  etc.  It was nothing I could possibly begin to recognize or describe as anything we know in the sky. It continued in a straight line across the sky heading east.  It then just fizzled out as if the light went out. We both were extremely intrigued. I jumped online right away but haven’t been ably to find anyone else that saw it.  It’s not possible. If we saw it  someone else had to as well. We watched it for about a minute. Please email me if you’ve seen the same thing. I know we weren’t the only ones! If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: wasthinking@gmail.com
405,2 witnesses. My boyfriend spotted a strange glowing orb in the sky over the town whilst I driving home . At first we thought it was fireworks but it did not fade and was stationary in the sky. It then began to move at a steady slow pace across the sky and stopped again.  It appeared to become very bright and then went dull  only to become very bright again. We live near an international airport and then began to think maybe it was a plane  but there is no way the movements this object made could be performed by a plane.  After about 10 mins   a plane did approach the airport and as the plane neared the glowing object it literally disappeared in front of our eyes. Very strange and eerie.
406,I and a reporter for local newspaper saw this same type of craft back in 1991 in Kittery If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: andovernative@yahoo.com
407,i was on my way to bigbucks bingo in clarksburge w. v.  i was driving east on 50 about halfway between belpre and clarksburge about 8am as i was coming up one of the many hills   i seen in the right side of my windshield what at first seam to be a flock of birds  but as i focused in on them they were round metalic discs grouped together in no certan formation but very close together my hair stood up  there were no lights on them  i saw them for about 15 to 20 seconds . i went to pull over to get a better look but they were ought of sight over the hills to the north. i was alone and only a few people beleave me i know wat i saw  the thing is there were so many of them and it was daylight and no lights on them has any one seen such a sight before like that. i will swear on a bible to the facts and take a lie detecter if need be  thats the only sighting ive ever seen but ive witnesed many other things in my life If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

408,i watched a light streak through the sky.faster than an airplane. it was not a small object but i can not reference the approximate size. it was not that high in the sky but it did pass through clouds. it was an orb of light that i thought at first hey its a shooting star.but it was not a shooting star.it was being controlled it seemed.its trajectory rose a bit as it streaked through the sky and then lowered slightly. not a plane.it was a rather large relatively low flying orb of light.just wondered if anyone else saw it? an orb of light that was being controlled.it wasnt that small but i cant guess how large it was. it flew low and very fast but not that fast i couldnt track it easily.

409,I was with my friend ryan when we saw a huge ufo looking object in the sky. It was about at 10:00 P.M. We were scared at 1st but then it seemed if the beings inside were calling us up.  The trance stopped when my mom shook my head. On the way home i heard a really weird voice inside my head.
410,They flew from Cleeve Road direction  across School Road  and over the trees through Chiltern Road  as I waited at the corner with a neighbour  as the first one was passin over us  it was pitch black  extremely low  and extremely slow  it passed through the circular haven of houses  and then slowly decended below them on the horizen  it made absolutley no noise as it did so  my neighbour and iI looked at one another in disbelief  she asked  did you just see that? I said yes.  My neighbour shortly left  5 mintutes later a second aircraft came following the exact trajectary  from where it emerged to where it disapeared  same height  speed  color  just slightly different shape  again no sound what so ever. A third aircraft followed  again  everything exactly the same  except a slightly different shape  and again  absolutly no sound what so ever  no visible type of engine lights or vapour trail  on a cold dark  and flying so low in wel lit wel populed area?

411,Was siting in house watching TV and heard what I thought was thunder got up walked out on deck to see if a storm was coming and noticed 4 bright lights stationary SSE of my house and right above the treeline called my wife to come look she didn’t have a clue either we continued to watch it periodically every 20 or so minutes and it remained there for 2 hrs and 15 min.  When we went out to look at 10;45 it was gone.Now I am 82 yrs old and have lived here all my life  never seen anything like this before just baffled. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: thechadster1970@yahoo.com
412,Originally  I thought it was a helicopter  but as I drove closer  I could see the shape of the craft.  It looked just like the movies.  It just hovered there at a fairly low height.  I’m amazed this hasn’t been reported by people.  It was pretty obvious and out in the open.
413,Just came outside 2 smoke n noticed a big blinking something. Watching it for about an hour and a half and what i thought was a star next to it  zoomed south and stopped.  Planes dont stop right? it pretty much darted. i recorded most of what ive been seeing but zoomed in on the large object when the smaller one moved and then stopped.  couldnt capture it on film. But am still trying. I am going to stay up until the sun comes up 2 c if they leave or whatever. i am completely sober…and my mother also witnessed the large object moving… If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

414,My son called me to the front window because he said he saw a UFO  I of course laughed till I saw what he was seeing and could not identify it myself.Please let me know if you know what these lights are  or if anyone else saw them.
415,I was walking home with a friend when we noticed a very abnormal object in the sky going very fast. We followed it running  and saw it stop abruptly sky.  All of a sudden another UFO appeared out of nowhere and they started to some sort of synchronistic dance around each other; a few minutes later  two more mysteriously appeared.  They formed a shape of a diamond and began the same “dance” modified for four ships. there must be someone else  that has seen something like this
416,While travelling south on 136 from swansea into warren RI  off to the west I saw a streaking white ball with a large tail coming towards earth.  Very big  bigger than any shooting star I’ve seen.  Looked like the classic comet.
417,When it got close to where the sun was coming up it dimmed not brighter
418,My husband had first noticed this bright object that at first we thought was a really bright star  but too close to be a star  a few days earlier. We looked at it with just our eyes and stayed over the tree tops for 30 to 40 minutes then just disappeared.  Tonight  September 12  2010 it appeared again at the exact same location between 7:45pm and 8:20pm. This time I took my camcorder outside to view in on a closer look.  As I zoomed in  it was weird. It at first appeared just a very white bright light  then it changed into a white circle with red in the center.  As we watched through the camera  it changed shape. It was almost as if it divided itself with a red ring around the center. With the lens zoomed in on it  we were able to see that it was moving more so than we could see with our naked eyes. Then for about three seconds the object divided itself into two separate objects.  Then went together as one again. And still the strangeness of the thing changing over and over again to look like a stretching of some sort with a red band in the center. The best thing that comes to mind when it took this shape was like a baby rattle with two balls on the end and a smaller handle in the middle.  My husband had to leave to run to Alabaster  Alabama  which is approximately ten miles away. He said he could see it on his way out of the treed area we live in. He watched it as he drove to Alabaster and it was still in the distance to the South of him back in this direction.  Then  he said he stood in the parking lot watching it and it just disappeared  not moving  just vanished.  I have this documented on video and my whole family stood and watched in amazement.  I would like to know if any other people in the vacinity of adjacent towns of Montevallo  Alabaster and here in Calera saw this object.
419,was very high in the sky then it got closer to the ground and hovered above the trees
420,They were lined up together.  The first red light went into the sky in a north easterly direction.  Then the other two left the same way and in the same direction.
421,Started at past San Bruno hills;moved Northeast past orion  moving in a straight line zig zagging occasionally at times past our house. Our horizon view is about 115 degrees and this disappeared in about 45 seconds. Very strange!  Never seen anything like it.
422,I thought it was a low star as a bright white light was first i noticed.  It appeared lower than normal for a star so i brought out the binoculars.  At that time  is when i noticed the color changes and then it started to move away slowly.  It appeared to stay stationary for quite some time before moving on.
423,It was a sunny cloudless day 3:00ish. My friend and i were at a golf range when i looked up and saw this classic disk shaped saucer in the sky coming in at angles so fast and stopping and hovering with lights revolving. It would hover and then like a blur it would appear at another spot in the sky in a grid like pattern. It made no sound. it then made its way away from us in a fast (i mean FAST) eratic grid like pattern.  There were dozens who saw it but i never heard about it in the media. IT WAS NOT HUMAN TECHNOLOGY….
424,me my little brother and older sister were in the front yard playing and we looked up and it was hovering above our house we ran to the back alol we heard  was a tremble and a swooshing sound and it was gone
425,It was dark and cold.  Snow was on the ground.  My parents were on their way home from Youngstown to Palmyra.  I took our dog outside to place her on the run.  I saw this bright light across the street behind our barn but to the left.  At one time  there had been an airstrip back there because our neighbor had a small plane. But this was not a plane.   It made no sound.  Quiet–we are in the country during the winter.  Not a sound was hurd.  I ran back in the house.   I was afraid but I did think about walking across the way to see what it was  but I didn’t.  I haven’t thought about this for years until I read about a citing in Portage County in 1966.
426,Someone saw a “drone” landing in a lot beside(south end) of the public beach in an empty lot. The Army has been there for a week. When they were asked about what was going on they responded that they were there doing research on hurricanes. They had large camo tents(those are down now)and a large radar also camo.  Yesterday the PBSO Special Ops truck was there. I might have believed the story since they didn’t tape off or evac. But the man who saw something land there the week before changed my mind. Was just wondering if anyone saw anything.
427,I remarked to my wife that two of the lights looked like they were playing leapfrog.  Those two looked like they were slowly moving in a line.   The trailing one then disappeared then seemed to reappear in front of the one that was ahead (two its left from my point of view).  Then the one that was now behind disappeared and seemed to reappear in front of the one that was leading at that point.   My wife did catch a very brief glimpse after which they all disappeared.  Total duration about 15 seconds.   Strangest thing about this sighting is that about 7:10 pm (about 25 minutes after I had arrived home in Barre) I saw the same type of lights with the same leapfrog effect while looking east just above and to the right of Butterfield Mtn.
428,I seen it when i was a kid  close up  5to10 min. I was riding a bike  it was right there at a play ground about 60 feet round or more  and a 100feet or less in the sky no noise at all.   Then i watch it take off no noise at all it was just there in the sky. It took off slow at first. And i followed on my bike    And then it was going like in a split sec i will never for get it i am 46 yr old now. My mom seen it too. I think others  seen it too. I am shore how old i was  or what year it was i would say 1970s
429,Subject: Very close view of UFO My wife and I had a very close up experience while living in Santa Clarita Valley. This occurred in 1978 but the memory lives in our minds as it were last night. We feel highly appreciative for the experience and are not afraid to openly discuss it without any intentions of financial gain. You may publish this account and we would be most willing to discuss it in public. It was the summer of 1978. Santa Clarita Valley is located north of the San Fernando Valley and north of Los Angeles. Santa Clarita was a small and laid-back community mostly referred to as Valencia. We recently relocated back from a two-year international management assignment followed by a two-year management assignment in Arizona. We then were transferred to California and chose Santa Clarita because of the open spacious country living  low crime statistics  no smog  and nice neighborhoods. I purchased a two-story corner house with a swimming pool. One Friday evening  I was using a long pole with an attached brush designed to sweep the walls of the pool. Our children would probably swim early the following morning and I wanted the pool to be clean. As I reached upwards on the pole to push downwards I saw a craft approaching. The craft was at a distance equivalent one or two short blocks away and not flying parallel to streets but at an angle on a southeastern direction. It was immediately obvious to me that the craft was not a helicopter nor airplane since these would not normally fly that low and the physical characteristics did not match these. At that distance the craft seemed wider  luminous with lights in circumference to the frontal section  (referred to as leading edge). I stared at it for a brief perplexed moment. After realizing that it was something out of the ordinary  I ran down the steps from the poolside deck platform where I had been standing. The platform was about four to five feet higher than the pool water and the opposite surrounding pool deck area. It was about 15 fast running steps from there to the backyard entry to the family room. My wife and two children were watching television there. I yelled for them to come outside and see but only my wife Gloria came out. We both walked fast towards the side of the pool opposite the platform side where I had been standing. By that time the craft was right over our pool area at an altitude of no more than 50-75 feet and perhaps even less. The craft had come to a stop right over our pool area as we stood bellow it. The craft made no sound whatsoever. It wobbled slightly as it were moved by the wind but there was no noticeable wind at that moment. The craft leaned forward and downwards and then we saw a large forward angled window  located bellow the leading edge that was perhaps 8 feet in length and 3-4 feet in height. We could see an orange bluish glow from inside but no occupants or controls. As the craft leaned forward I could see light emanating from its upper section and not from the pool lights reflection since the pool lights would be unable to reflect on the upper section. The craft seemed to be manufactured as one solid piece. There were no visible seams or rivets. The bottom of the craft was concave towards the center. In the deepest section of the concave center two rectangular objects were visible and ran the length of the deep concaved section and seemed to be a few feet apart from each other. The craft had an upper dome with porthole like windows but no internal visibility. The upper dome was round and centered in relation to the lower part of the craft with no visible seams. The total height of the craft appeared to be the equivalent of a one and half story typical track residence or less.  I calculated the height by comparing it to our two-story house. The diameter was approximately 50-75 feet or less. There were no visible markings  insignias or identification like character on the craft. Under the front leading edge of the circular craft was some ski like devices with two side-by-side configurations. The design I cannot replicate even though I always scored high in I.Q  tests where design progressions (similar to mathematical progressions) had to be decided from multiple drawing choices. I also remember thinking they were too far forward from the crafts center of gravity something we studied in Group Propulsion in relation to the length and loading of aircraft. The ski like devices were similar to the letter S with the top of the S facing forward but with more elaborate details filling the gaps. At the time my conclusion was they were some type of hanging or anchoring device. During the entire experience lasting some 45 seconds  my wife kept repeating “Oh my God!” over and over again. I tried to concentrate on details and in my mind kept repeating “take me with you.”  We were both frozen in awe and disbelief. It was like seeing a large bus that I previously described as a Greyhound bus floating over your house.  Both of us look upwards and did not speak to each other during the sighting. There was no fear  an unprompted paralysis  and a high respect to what we were seeing.  We both had the sensation of being watched primarily because the craft maneuvered downwards at an angle towards us and then regained a level position parallel to the ground.  As a part of my analysis during the experience I listened for other engines  other crafts  the possibility that this craft was being suspended from another craft as a hoax but concluded there were no other man-made craft in the vicinity. The craft then began to move at a very slow speed of around 20 miles per hour. I jumped on a wall that surrounded our backyard so that I could see the trajectory. I saw between houses as it continued at that speed for at least 7 miles from our house and heading in a southeast direction from Santa Clarita over a mountainous section of Los Angeles County.  I instructed my wife not to discuss it but to try to draw what she saw and then we would compare drawings. My drawings had more details. Then we began comparing the experience and both had seen the very same details. My conclusion is that the craft wanted us to observe it or perhaps was examining us. I am 100% sure this was not a man-made craft or technology. I am also convinced by the event that U.S. Government intelligence agencies know we are being visited by extra-terrestrials and are hiding facts.  To me the only rationale reasons is because they lied once about their existence (perhaps Roswell and others) and may cause the loss of statutory governmental powers as citizens realize that borders  religions and global federal governments are meaningless and helpless. My conclusions lead me to think that visitors do not wish to work with a single government as they are roaming global skies making their presence. There were lingering questions in my mind after the sighting. Since the craft must originate from an advanced civilization why do they need windows? My technical assumption is that an advanced civilization would have cameras on the exterior to duplicate exactly what is visible outside of the craft. Why were we allowed to see the interior through the large window but not the occupants? After reporting the experience to the local Sheriff said they had no reports.  Years later after writing the experience on the Internet someone who claimed he was with NASA automated airport sciences called me and said that his call was unofficial. The only somewhat related experience was during a father daughter overnight camping event. The event was prior to our sighting experience. Several of my neighbors were FBI agents. During the outing two of the agents who had daughters were standing close to each other looking at the visible stars. One of them whispered to the other that he heard that strange crafts were often visible in the area. I was standing a few feet away from them and could hear them. During my earlier education  I graduated and was certified in Group Propulsion Systems and had a choice to either continue studies as a Flight Engineer or Aeronautical Engineering. I selected Aeronautical Engineering and attended Northrop Institute of Technology. In Group Propulsion Systems we became highly familiar with aircraft  mechanical and electrical systems and all flight disciplines  flight and design configurations and propulsion sciences.  I am still more familiar with aircraft functions than an automobile. After two years of study I switched to business management at another university  was an early participant in IT as a systems analyst followed by executive positions in the computer and software industry eventually forming my own international management consulting and international business services integration organization. I am now an active portfolio investor and international business but retired.
430,It was 730am and the sun wasn’t over the horizon but it was getting light.  The two jets in my vision were still in shadow with no sunlight hitting them. The object was shining very bright in the sunlight and was bigger than the jet it seemed to be tailing. You could tell it was huge and way up there.   The jets continued as the object stopped and it was stationary for 30 to 40 seconds and than it left my vision by proceeding straight up until it disappeared. The entire sighting was less than a minute   but it was an exciting minute for me.
431,I went to the store just down the street from my house about 9pm. When I came out about 15 minutes later and headed on foot back home and reached the corner bar I noticed people standing outside looking up at the sky. When I looked up I bout fainted when I saw this UFO.  It just glided and made no sound. Each window (what appeared to be windows)was a different color.(red  blue yellow green & orange)and went completely around the craft. Everyone there was completely silent  just watching it in disbelief of what we were all seeing. Then someone said  what is that? A man answered “it’s gotta be a UFO”.  I then went on home still amazed at what I saw. When I entered my home my then husband asked me what took me so long that I was gone an hour and a half. I looked at the clock because I thought I was only gone about 30 minutes but he was right. Where had I been for all that time??  I still cannot answer that. I called the airport and told the man that answered the phone about what I and other people saw but I don’t think he took me seriously.
432,i was outside smoking in my front yard. my son was with me he was 4 at the time. He pointed at the sky and asked me what star that was. i looked up and saw what looked like an old headlight about 1000 ft above my driveway. i tried to walk toward it and it went straight up getting smaller and smaller until it was gone. it took just seconds. i haven’t seen one since…
433,A large bright circular object hanging over Edmonton  just below the cloud bank.  Completely stationary  and lacking the marker lights and strobe of an aircraft.  And then in a millisecond it was gone  just blinked out. Sorry no pics  I was driving and it was gone by the time I got into a safe position to stop and fished my phone out of my pocket.
434,Driving North on I-5 just south of Wilsonville.  Saw bright blinding lights 20 miles off over Portland. Heading south at a high rate of speed and went down just off freeway but couldn’t see anymore.
435,UFO appeared out of nowhere  and just hovered motionless. It made no sound. Our AM radio went to static as UFO passed. I had a strange taste in my mouth  not a smell  but a taste. The best way to describe it was almost like Battery Acid? I was with two other friends  they complained about the taste as well.  This was a classic saucer shaped craft. We were ages 11-12 at the time of this sighting.
436,I was outside the Georgetown Wal-Mart and just looked up in the northern corner near Wendys. Thats when I saw a bright orange light. It flashed once then I saw another light that did the same. Next I saw another set of lights three total in a straight line then they disappeared.
437,I watched the object for hours making maneuvers at and with such speed that a human could not endure the kinetic forces involved. Instantaneously making angular transitions beyond 90 degrees. I observed this multiple times during deer hunting seasons in the late 60’s and early 70’s. These episodes struck me as practice sessions. I don’t care what skeptics may think. I know what I saw.
438,Okay so I just woke up and had a rather disturbing experience. I have never seen a UFO before  but I know I was awake when I saw this and I know I’m not crazy. From the kitchen window of my house I thought I saw a large truck or other vehicle across the park from my house but then it began rising into the air and that caught my attention.  I quickly went outside to make sure I wasn’t seeing any kind of reflection or my mind playing tricks on me. It was at least 100 feet from where I was and a nearby tree gave me a sense of scale. It had to be at least as big as a semi truck trailer and it seemed silent. It was either diamond shaped or triangular and reflecting sunlight brightly off the bottom and around the edges.  I only saw it for about 10 seconds as it lifted up  hovered and then quickly moved off toward the west. I live in the city (Provo) and surely other people must have seen this it was daylight?! There is even a small airport here so I am hoping they have some kind of evidence on their radar. I know I am not crazy and if this is real then it is the most important thing I have seen in my life.
439,Wife and I were traveling from my parent’s house in Morgan City back to our house in Algiers  Louisiana  early Sunday night. What I thought was blinding bright headlights from an oncoming car up the road  turned out to be this object hovered over the trees about 2 miles ahead.  When we reached the object  we pulled over to the shoulder and I got out to look at it.  The object was on the opposite side of the road about 10 feet above the trees.  I stood there and starred at the object trying to figure out what it was  –  no noise at all  no hum  no rurh  only silence. Lights were searching  on and off  below in the trees.  Eventually  it banked  slightly and slowly moved away  further from the road until I could not see it anymore. My wife was calling to me to “Get in the Car” and we left for home  discussing possibilities all the way home. You would have had to have seen this to believe it  –  I see no other explanation other than “out of this earth” I’ve just recently become interested  again in doing some checking to see if anyone else has seen anything along that stretch of hwy 90.  Its been over 40 years ago and I have lived in Texas now for decades  –  that area is bound to have developed and probably not isolated the way it used to be.
440,I was driving down the road when I looked into the sky and I saw a bright light right above the tree line. I followed it looking out the drivers side window all the way to the windshield. I have seen a falling star and this wasn’t anywhere close to that. I was able to focus on it and follow it as it was able to speed off.
441,series of 5 lights appeared while we attended a memorial service. it waS APPROX 6:30 PM MST.  It was still light out  clear skies and sunny but the 5 lights were still very visible.   There were a series of 3 lights that were grouped together  they would rotate clock wise staying grouped together as if they were conteded  two other separate lights were traveling at even pace but were located to the east of the 3 grouped lights  these two separate lights were not grouped together.   The lights appeared to be traveling west to south east at a slow rate of speed.  My son pointed out the lights to me and my wife.  We all witnessed the lights.  Not sure what the object was but I have never heard of an aircraft traveling in this fashion.  Only had my cell phone camera and when I tried to take a picture  i could not see the image in the phone.
442,2 bright orange ball like shapes.hovering in the air then darted vvfast to the right then back to the left and both together side by side flew in a straight line abt 3xfaster than an aeroplane
443,Seen at first from the kitchen window  I saw a red “star”-like object travel over the city in a gradually heightening arch towards the East. The light was unchanging (it did not flash)  but occasionally dimmed as it passed behind clouds.  I ran out to the back garden  and watched for several moments until I could no longer see it due to nearby houses. Two other people in the house also witnessed the object  though I had no telescope or pair of binoculars to hand  and it didn’t occur to me to take a picture.
444,It made no sound at all. I saw it in the field and wondered what it was so I walked a little further and then it shot up in the air really fast. I ran in side and call for my sister and father and they came out. By time we got out there it was about 100 feet in the shy and slowly went over the house and as we were all in shock drove behind the barn and there were no signs at this time that were visible to what we could see.
445,the first light would just hover then disappear. Then it plus 2 more on either side would appear and hover. Then 2 more  then 2 more  until there were 7 in total. They appeared at different parts of the horizon  on the left side and then the right side seeming to take up incredible distances.  Always an odd number of lights  never even. Witnessed by 4 other adults at the hotel plus the guests on either side of us.
446,5 -7 bright yellow lights  well spaced  moving East to West directly over Ponca City at a high rate. No sound was apparent  as would have been if they had been jets  light planes or helicopters. Examination of three of these revealed no navigation lights (red or green).
447,It was visible against blue sky being white and lite up by low sun in sky. My husband saw it also. It moved very slowly without noise. As we were about to put binocs on it it disappeared.
448,Well I have to say I saw this sphere for almost a week straight in the later evening hours. I asked my husband what he thought it was.  Told me he didn’t know. 3 days later looking at it again a small ball of light came out of it and then went back into the light. Unexplainable.
449,I was in my living room and looked out the window. In the sky  I saw what looked like a round? silver/grey ball zoom by rather quickly. (I couldn’t tell it’s shape as it was moving very fast). I got up and ran to the window and it had already travelled over downtown. I watched it continue to travel south  then it split into three individual balls of light that spread apart from each other  and all totally disappeared.  All of this happened in what seemed like a minute or less. After it disappeared  I suddenly and for no reason became very emotional.
450,On the 2nd of August 2010 at The Dolphin Show in Seaworld in Queensland  Australia. The show was viewed by approximately 50-80 other people. At the time I did not hear or see it or even realise I had taken a photo with this object in until I got back home on the 6th. I used a Nikon D80 with a shutter speed of 1/200sec. Rapid succession as quick as the camera would allow.
451,I was really young at this time when headed home with my parents. My sister and I were in the back of a station wagon.  It was daytime and I think it may have been around summer time.  We looked out the back car window and saw a huge circular thing with colored lights on the bottom. We heard no sound or saw no movement. We did not say anything about this at the time.  I don’t remember anything after that.  I did mention it to my sister many years later to see if she remembered seeing this and she said she did  but we did not remember anything else.  My parents did not say anything  and I don’t know if they saw what we saw.
452,I believe what I have captured on my digital camera are Orbs  but I am not completely sure? The one photo you can clearly see an illuminated trail following behind the ball shaped figure. And in the other closeup photo  notice the design inside the Orb shaped figure to me looking similar to an Aztec drawings or Myan calander? but very distintive in having definate design and not of random pattern. Please note  while taking ALL photos these objects were NOT visible either in the sky or through the cameras LCD screen. The objects appeared in the photos but I could not physically see them only after the photo was taken  not before or during the photo  only after the photos were taken were they visable. (meaning that I could not visually see them directly). Also note that using the same camera on the same night  only pointing the camera in a different area (neighbors yard) the photo is clear of any Orbs and or objects. Also using the same camera  taking photos close to the same time as before  the photos are completely clear (This was about a week later) It seems some evenings would be more active than others. Really not sure what to think about all of this but I will say  some very strange things have been occuring the past three to four years and I would like to find some answers.

453,I was inside my house watching t.v when all of a sudden I heard this really loud noise that to me sounded like a tornado so I walked outside too see what the noise was and the noise continued to get louder as if something was coming towards me.  I looked up into the sky and I saw an object in the horizon coming towards my general direction which I could not identify at the time. as the object continued to get closer I could start seeing the aircraft better due to the illumination of the moon.  when I first spotted it it was traveling fast but once it passed my house  it banked left and dramatically began decreasing its speed to the point where it was traveling no faster than 5 to 10 mph. the ship hovered over my street for 5 to 10 seconds.  as I focused my eyes I made out the shape of a thin triangle ship with 3 orbish lights On the bottom with one  red blinking light on the top where the driver would be located. also there were several beams of light no stronger than a candle powered helicopter light looking straight up in the air into the clouds.  I was puzzled by this because the lights were being controlled and shining above the craft. As if searching for something at this point I was in shock by what I was seeing and decided to try to run in my house and grab my phone to try to catch a high definition video but j also decided to wake my dad up because I was pretty terrified and I felt like it knew of my presence.  my .dad and I walked back outside but the ship was now out of sight. but the noise it was putting off was not and it still sounded as if it was right over us. my dad testifies what I just said and thinks that the roar was breaking the sound barrier
454,My buddy mike and I were driving into Middletown when we saw a metallic silver shield in the sky it was there not moving for five minutes or so then there was a flash and it disapeared….in the middle of the day  not a cloud in the sky!
455,these things can be seen often  most times you can easily confuse them for being just another star or maybe the reflection of a satellite  but the way these lights behaved  satellites don’t move the way these things were moving  my friend and I made a joke and categorized some of them because of their flight formation  one was the drunk ufo because it seemed to wiggle in short s waves as it flew  when it reached right above my head though  im assuming a mile high?  i know nothing of measurments but the light was no bigger then a grain of rice  all of a sudden it burst into a big ball of light that was as big as the moon held for a second and then vanished  very strange  one time i was with my friend in the middle of the day   ey mike imagine we saw a ufo in the middle of the day?  yeah right man i don’t think that’s    as hes talking i look up in the sky and i was so freaked because there was this oval jet black  :Thing” flying and like  flipping  like a coin  as it flew and i like  LOOK!  so this thing is flying about  1 inch per 3seconds across the sky  kind of looked like a jet black grain of rice lol  but this thing goes off maybe a mile from uss and we can still make it out  flipping  but all of a sudden it dissapeared  what’s weird is that it must of been extremely flat because everytime it turned  it would seem to dissapear  as if you flipped a coin  so weird   now i live 3 towns away in freeport  i havnt had the time to observe the sky here in freeport but the few times i  have  i’ve spotted 2 of these little odd lights at night  i dont doubt they are still active around farmingdale though 
456,This Unidentified Arial Anomaly was witnessed on January 11 2015  Lee is a Teacher who was at the event we were speaking at where the sighting occurred   During the Break we went outside to attempt to meditate on a sightings and bellow the cloud haze lowered this anomaly into view that everyone at the event got to witness as well as everyone else on Whittier Blvd in East LA that day that pulled over to see what we were all watching  i mean if you saw a group of 40 people looking in aw in the sky wouldn’t you stop and take a look too?  This Anomaly appeared as a dark object that first flew south then made a turn towards the west  a directional change showing us that it had a possible intelligent flight path.
457,it was a pulsating light that was very brilliant moving across the sky from the north to the south. my buddy and i were astounded by what we saw because the light brighted everything around us. after the light in the sky faded away we were shocked after a few minutes to here a noise coming from the left of us about 100 ft. when we looked over to where the noise was coming from we saw a green orb moving up and down off the ground about 5 ft making a kind zziv zziv noise.  the orb was about 3 ft in diameter. in all these years i have never been able to figure out what it was and never heard of any reports of what we saw in the sky.
458,I was asleep in my bed when I was awoken with a persistent ringing in my ears  their was light everywhere brite I remember being lifted out of my bed and feeling weightless  at first I thought I was dreaming till I cut my hand on something not sure what.  as I left my room the light got brighter  I was in a large dark room with a table in the center  with a blue haze covering it. I was placed their and when I looked around I saw other children with me all of them around my age I was 13 at the time.  the rest is fuzzy but I know the experienc e was real  I know their are others out their who have sharred this experience. thanks for listening.

459,it looked like a large ship when i looked up. it had a glow around it but no specific color. it some some windows that looked like port-holes on a ship but they had like red lifts comin from them. i was yelling for somebody to get a camara and by the time someone came out it just took-off so-fast. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: pi_novation@yahoo.com
460,This was by far the most strange thing i have seen. Me and my family were riding our pontoon back from the firework show and we saw three lights that were rotating in a triangular shape. When we tried to take footage as well as pictures the lights wouldn’t show up in the video camera or my brothers phone. We watched the lights appear and disappear within minutes.
461,It was at clear day light the ufo was a bit hard to see cause of the reflections coming off it but the green glow gave it away i walked out of the house to have a better look and once i looked again i saw it for one second and it took off in a blurry speeding flash into the sky about 2 or 3 times faster than a speeding shooting star but before the sighting ive had wierd dreams about being abducted but i remember it was like it was real
462,I was going to work and had my windows down because it was a nice morning.  I stopped at the stop sign at 10th and Douglas.  Looking right to left for traffic  I caught this object out of the corner of my eye.   I looked at it and it seemed to float above the tree tops right behind the Derby Gas station that was located on the corner.  As I looked at it  it slowly began to move to the west and I got scared and got out of there.  It made no noise and it was NOT AN AIRPLANE.  I worked at the Air Force base and knew this thing was not any airplane I had ever seen.
463,This Unidentified Ariel Phenomenon was Documented On a Telescope By Jay Lee and Myself  it was on January 26 2014 in Mcarther Park. It’s a two man Job to record with a telescope and not an easy one either  Hans has to track this object on the view finder then the person manning the camera has to notify him when it is in frame and focus the image. This anomaly is to date my favorite at how By Far in it’s features it displays and how clear an image we were able to Record off of it. We have no idea if it is mechanical or biological but the on thing that is certain is that this Ufo is till today unexplained. some refer to it as an ebe  uap  aap or even ovni. This object was also captured on multiple cameras that day so there isnt just the telescope footage of it but however the telescope did get the best look at it. Here is the video if you would like to take a look
464,Mom was hanging out clothes to dry. She yelled for me to come outside  I was about 14. There was a gray cigar-shaped object above the clouds. It was solid  not a lenticular cloud. It was hovering in one spot.  It was not a blimp or balloon or any aircraft I have ever seen. As the clouds were moving  it was a breezy day  it would disappear behind a cloud  but stayed in the same place so we could see it when the cloud passed. After a minute or two it disappeared behind a cloud but was gone when the cloud moved on.
465,On a very clear night at around 10pm  the bright white light could have been easily mistaken for an airplane by an untrained eye. I concentrated on it since it was flying straight towards the park and getting larger.  As it got way below cruising altitude i did not see warning lights under the aircraft  and was shocked it was still flying towards the earth and not parallel to it. It made a quick turn north at a comet pace and dissappeared. It reminded me of a mix of a fast comet and a commercial airplane. All i saw was a bright light

467,Ufo Transforms Over Los Angeles Skies while several Eyewitnesses see on august  22nd  2015 at 6:42 pm at Hollydale Park Southgate CA  -Best regards Fausto Perez Co-Founder of the research orginization L.A. Ufo Channel Producer of the FaustoUfo Show Youtube.com/Liro51 Facebook.com/UfoContact FaustoUfo@gmail.com
468,Looked like the color a hot air balloon would produce but its movements were to swift and quick. Then suddenly it changed color from the glowing reddish orange to a white light. And stayed in one place and hoovered and bounced around. I have some short video and another picture if you email i can send it to you. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: nrrodriguez86@gmail.com
469,Silent  fairly fast-moving and it definitely changed directions at three different times  somewhat in an S-Shape.
470,This Was not a ufo as such – but rather something very out of this world.  Aprox 2 am. October 9 or 10 being after midnight. Went to bed and noticed flashing light on my ceiling. Got out of bed and saw lightning striking constantly in the same place. Not one or two times but like 20 – 30 times within 30 seconds maybe more.  After the lightning a series of huge balls of light lighting the whole horizon the size of atomic bombs. ( I thought thats what they were. I woke my partner up and she witnessed the same thing! I grabbed her and threw her to the ground waiting for a shock wave! after 20 seconds or so We looked out side and noticed the sky had almost gone as light as day! ( Yellowish light ) At 2AM. I thought The Sun Or something had exploded!!  I thought there would surely be reports the next day being it was close to the city – but nothing. to this day it puzzles me. Anyone seen anything similar? If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: Djses9@gmail.com
471,Me and two friends were standing on trail talking for 15 min when I noticed 2 objects descending over us my friend shined his flash light on one of them and instantly a green ora available of light surrounded the craft and it stopped and hovered for a few min the other ufo continued  to descend down into the park at this point tree level we walked back to were in went and it was hovering over the canal that runs threw the park the other ufo went way up and just hovered there the whole time one of my friends started pushing his bike right to the one in the park me and the other friend stayed about 1000 feet from it he walked to the ufo and stood 6 feet from it for an hour while we watched it dispense something in the water then move up to the trees were we watched for 45 min before I got scared enough to get out of their the ufo was still in the park when we left and they did something to the tree which I went back the next day and took pictures of we all still can not believe what we seen very up close and personal If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

472,I was just shutting my window and when I glanced at the stars on such a clear night  I noticed what I thought was an airplane because if was blinking.  As I watched it  I realized not only was it not moving but it blinked  blue  red and white flashes and a short beam of light would occasionally be seen coming from it  like the beam of a headlight and then disappear.   So what is this?  It is not like any star I have ever seen  it clearly had bright flashes of red  blue and white lights.  I don’t know what it is but I don’t like it.  I remember my neighbor telling me about five years ago she saw something just like this and I didn’t believe her  I now believe her.  Won’t sleep much tonight.
473,Appeared to reflect the sun light of the setting sun at times which looked red to orange-red
474,I saw a white cloud with a blue/green tint to it going over my house wile i was smoking a cigarette   i know it wasn’t a cloud because it was moving too fast and it was lit up this has really freaked me out as it is the second time i have seen something like this in the past month.
475,6 reddish orange dots in a circle then one leads and the rest follow in a straight line and then they stop form another circle then one leads again to the same spot and they all follow again in a line form another circle then one by one they shoot up into the sky.

476,It was just after 7 am  I was driving east when a very bright orange yellow cigar shaped object caught my attention. I watched it for a bit while looking for a place to pull off the road. By the time I could pull over the object was gone.  It seemed as if it wasn’t moving from my perspective as I watched it  and unfortunatly I did’t see how it vanished from view. I don’t know what I saw  but I do know it wan’t a plane (least none that I’ve ever seen or researched). If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

477,They just hover and can be seen with the naked eye by anyone on clear night skies. They constantly moved in the sky and hover where ever I’m present. I sent out two names and contacts to Mufon of the fleet of Ufos that follow me around the world from Joshua Tree. I also sent this report to etletstalk and other UFO organizations. They look like very bright.
478,First I was taking out the trash  as I looked up I saw a red orb in the sky  I looked over it and thought it was mars  later I walked out to feed the dogs and it was still their  them I couldn’t take my eyes off of it. It began to rise   then it shot to another location in the sky and made a straight line  intersecting with two other glowing orbs
479,Saw a bright star and it was flashing  then it came shooting down behind the mountains in the distance.  After that  the sky started to flash orange and green.   It had a shape of a rainbow or dome and the sky just lighting up in that area mostly orange and some white very frequently.  Then I saw an oval shaped red object come down behind the mountains.   I could still barely see it thru the trees.  It was red and I could see many lights on it shaped like domes – all red.  I also saw another object in the sky that looked liked a star but this one had colors.   I could distinctly see red  white and maybe a greenish color.  It looked liked the lights were moving because I would see red  then white  then a greenish color rotating.  This has been going on for hours.  At 1:00 in the morning  the flashing lighting up in the sky moved to the right and is not flashing frequently at all  but it still is and is mostly white flashes.  I also hear a strange noise in that direction.   It repeated it three times and that is all I got.  This is not a joke.  We saw this with our own eyes.   I wonder if anyone else witnessed this?

480,This is a story of an astonishing true account of a “close encounter of the FIFTH kind” which a man named Richard R. Giroux  experienced on October 12  1994 on the rim canal of Lake Okeechobee  Florida.  The contact was deliberate and the communication profound. The visitors shared in detail their true nature  their mission  and the reason for their connection with Earth since before the dawn of antiquity.  The details of what they shared were not provided through conversation  but via a direct implant of knowledge. They also shared numerous and detailed future sequential events that will verify their message. The Visitors. This is a completely true but amazing experience  and I strongly feel it will interest you. It’s another strange thing that’s going on with some people  a twist of things happening in recent years  worldwide. It was Wednesday  October 12 1994. In what follows a name is changed withholding a man’s identity. Everything else is exactly as it happened. That day around 9:00 p.m. we arrived at Okeechobee from our day’s work in Boca Raton. Okeechobee is a Seminole Indian name meaning Big Lake. Joe was with me. We are computer engineers developing an important product for a big client. It was a difficult job. We needed a change of scene and he was glazed over too from the day’s problems. A ride in the country would give us a change to rest our heads. Escaping our noisy hotel was part of the answer  so driving eighty-five miles to Big Lake was welcome. The beach is usually good but typically it’s a parking problem. At Okee there’s cool clean air with a chorus of wild creatures to hear all around … relaxing. There‘s no stress or tension. What a place! We arrived with just time enough to fix a drink and walk outside by the rim canal. It felt so fine being there on a perfectly clear cool moonless night. The air was wonderful and stars were bright. Looking to the right we immediately saw a light coming. It was over the canal about 800-feet in the air a quarter-mile away. Something close was flying our way. I was thinking This ought to be interesting. Little did I know! It seemed like a helicopter by its speed and height  with a big light under it. At the same time there was a twin engine plane flying out over the lake just behind it about two miles away. The plane was noisy and gaining altitude from take off at Okeechobee Airport. So it’s natural that I wouldn’t hear a helicopter coming our way. Only it wasn’t a helicopter  not a plane either  and it’s coming along in the air too quietly. We’re near Route 441 with some distant sounds of traffic going by. But I couldn’t hear this thing coming and it’s getting close. We saw a steady bright glow under it  like a big searchlight playing into the canal. Whatever it is  it had no flashing lights of any kind. But all aircraft are required to have strobe lights at night. As it came from behind a nearby tree into clearer view  we saw it’s a brightly lit disk and still moving toward us. I said What the hell is that? Joe was glued. I just watched without a thought and looked hard trying to decide what it was. The disk was still flying toward us  slowly  maybe 20-mph. It flew the same way over the canal until about 300-yards away. Then it went gradually higher to about 400-yards  almost over head. It’s changing direction slightly now  moving to the opposite edge of the canal and over a point about 100-yards in front of us. It slowed  descending as it went by. It’s absurd not being aware that it’s a UFO but it never entered my mind. A UFO is exactly what we saw  the real thing. I never saw one before and this one is really close. It didn’t get closer than 200-yards to where we stood. As the craft flew by  it was perfectly circular  about 35-feet in diameter give or take five. At that height it looks bigger than  say  a full moon rising on the horizon and it’s brighter. As it moved it made a bright white glow with a hint of yellow  bright but without a strain… easy on the eyes. No sound  I said – it was totally silent. By then there’s no noisy plane nor any road traffic being heard  no more distractions anywhere. The craft was coming down  low  slowing to a stop and moving east 100-yards toward Nubbin Slough. In five seconds it flew from high over head to where it’s hanging in the air over the levee. We saw it clearly  parked a little above the levee up a 20-degree angle. As it descended the disk-glow was harder to see the lower it came  because the angle was smaller and the glow diminishing. It came to a stop  suspended motionless in the air 100-feet past the ridge of the levee toward the lake  a distance of about 250-yards from us. The craft became dark. Two small soft lights appeared  one each side  square light images although not big as windows. They are reference lights to help us with what happened next. It’s on edge-view and I saw its silhouette  because there’s a lot of light in the haze behind it from the well lit power plant 15-miles away. The plant was under construction around the clock and covered with lights for the night shifts. It looked like a vaudeville straw hat on edge view. The upper part of this thing was dark but showed a rectangular silhouette  flat on top  and not as wide as its base where we had seen the glow. The top is a shallow wide cylinder shape. The top part is three times thicker than the base and eight times wider than thick. The base is thinner and a third wider than the upper part… maybe 15% wider on each side than the top. I looked for how the base is connected to the top  curved or straight  but couldn’t see it. It’s a lame description but it was dark. When the craft came low and to a stop  I was thinking Now I will see what they’re doing! Without thinking UFO I knew they weren’t like us inside. This was really different. It amazes me  not realizing the things I know. Like  how might I know ostensibly never having seen one before? Did they send me subconscious thoughts already? And I mean  Lake Okeechobee is a military operating area  and there are rumors we may have flying craft of similar appearance. But this craft is nothing of ours. No question  this technology is special. Very quickly after this thought  something happened to me. I didn’t remember it clearly for weeks. What I remembered instead was  that at about this point we turned and went into the house for a few minutes  then came out to look for it again. It’s still visible  glowing over the levee about two miles down  past Nubbin toward the southeast and Indiantown. Again  we turned away with it still in view and went back into the house. The clock read 9:45. Wasn’t that something? Joe said Yeah  you know  some things just happen. He couldn’t function either  both of us were subdued. I was drained. Sitting in the house I was tired and empty of thought. I just couldn’t put two thoughts together. I went outside looking at things again and found my vision was different. I could see really well in the dark but soon came back inside. We immediately turned in for the night without a word. Next morning it’s never mentioned by either of us  nothing. Joe never brought up anything about it  not ever. It’s awhile before I came around to it with him. Months later after remembering most of what happened  I phoned Joe about what he recalls. He said Nothing. Months after that I sat him down and probed him to see if he remembered them talking to us. All he’d say was Maybe they were talking to you. And with a grin he said They found no intelligent life here and moved on. It seems all he remembers was seeing a ‘fast moving’ light. It’s a clue …maybe he’s on different ‘time’ than me in this experience. I’d been thinking He simply didn’t want to remember. And he doesn’t want to talk about it at all. At least he knows they came  I’m thinking. He’s my witness. We saw the most incredible event in anyone’s life experience  uncommon in all human experience  yet we lost interest in it? We turned our backs  headed inside and simply went to bed. Nothing like this could happen in normal circumstances. But there’s certainly nothing normal about these circumstances. Something very different happened that October night. After they left us I was mentally washed out  tired and just about dysfunctional. It’s the chance of a lifetime for two curious people like us  who are no pedestrians to technology and who earned educations in four scientific disciplines between us. We could’ve done much more investigating at the time  because there were binoculars  a camera  and a 2½-inch refracting telescope all within five yards of the door from where we stood. None of it mattered. We simply couldn’t function acting on our own will. We had no initiative  none  zero. Best I could do was look and wonder. After weeks of trying  memory and the details began coming. I did it mostly while driving to work with plenty time to think. Eventually I got nearly everything back. Here’s what happened. We watched as the craft came lower  stopped  and became darker. Two small lights appeared. The craft was parked in the air just inside the levee of Big Lake maybe as close as 200-yards away. As we watched  something hit me  a marvelously happy feeling and I knew at the time it was coming from the craft. I thought THIS is a really good sign whoever they are. The happiest feeling of anticipation had suddenly come upon me. I knew to expect something wonderful to happen between them and me. They were doing something to affect my mental state giving me a wonderful feeling of euphoria. It‘s nothing like anything I’ve ever felt  a totally joyful happy feeling beyond description. I was so glad they were here and understood  waiting for something. I dared not move a muscle although knew I wasn’t restrained. Whatever came next I wanted to be part of it. Next  I was sensing a projection of thought to me  when soon thought-speech appeared in mind in my own idiom. But there’s some fumbling  because I first heard some unintelligible words and a series of growls. I thought It’s growling at me. But it definitely seemed like a recording coming up to the wrong speed. Sure  as in  they don’t know how to operate their ship. Much later I saw they were showing me that technology is being used. It sounded like technology was being engaged and directed to me. It’s growling  why’s that? … thinking This might become difficult… how very odd all this is. Next I heard the word… Mrep! (Visitor) Mrep  what the hell is…? With that exchange we were talking. It’s like they’re tuning on what I was getting. How could they know? Yes  they’re already reading my thought responses. We’re communicating! They’re talking with me and the warm feeling of expectation was at its height. I thought this is actually happening  happening here and right now. Right now! Wide-eyed I couldn’t believe it  thinking It’s too fantastic… they’re real  what a discovery! A man’s voice was very friendly  saying Yes  up here. We’re here. You’re looking at us and we can see you. You hear us talking to you. We know you’re interested in us. It’s okay  we won’t harm you. (Visitor) At this exact moment Joe said Damn! Obvious excitement  because he realized he could hear them too. They’re here and they’re talking to us! But there’s a problem  I notice these speech-thoughts went by really fast for a typical English-speaking dialog. It wasn’t like two people speaking with each other  where more time is inserted between thoughts  where we allow each other time to think in the process. It was going by as a flood to grasp  near my limit. I found it difficult and didn’t want it this way  but it was also all clearly heard and understood. There was only time to respond  no time to form any questions  which may have been deliberate. It seems to account for speed of the exchange. They were deliberately pacing the exchange so we couldn’t ask them any questions. Next the voice said… We want to meet and show you around. We do stop and show others sometimes and they have a good time. We want to be friendly. Would you like to see everything here and have a ride? (Visitor) Immediately  a silly image of a guy popped into mind. The guy was sitting in a deckchair with sunglasses  a blue blazer  white slacks and shoes  with a captain’s cap. If this was supposed to be an image of me having a good time  it struck me as totally bogus  because I would not imagine something so ridiculous in my situation. They must have sent it. I thought nice try. But it’s also okay with me. My thought in exchange made it okay  because I obviously knew it wouldn’t be like that. It was humorous. I’m thinking now  these guys do have a sense of humor. Imagine that? I’m invited. I was so excited and thought Really! …and emphatically thought Yes! I was so happy  so excited and grinning hugely. I shot a glance at Joe. He had on his biggest smile  too  although he didn’t look at me. Quickly  I looked back to the craft feeling they didn’t want my attention anywhere else. No voice said so but I understood a thought to be… Now look here a moment. (Visitor) I replied thinking Okay …doing just that. We had switched from our explicit dialog to a direct implicit thought-flow between us; telepathy  explicitly vs. implicitly. Between reference lights I could see a tiny spot beginning to boil and enlarge. There’s a grayish-green circular spot and it’s getting bigger. A fuzzy spot had formed and was expanding but slowly at first. It appeared to be swarming with motion and became a cloud-like image emanating from the edge-center of the craft. It was swarming in the sense that it appeared to be boiling with a lot of motion and was fuzzy to look at. It was fairly uniform. Next I saw circular arcs being traced out one at a time. The circular cloud was growing out of a tiny port on the craft. Arcs appeared at the edge of the circular cloud at twelve o’clock and moved on a curve to its center at the port. Arcs emanated from the same point-source and immediately began getting bigger  growing into a tear-shaped envelope. One of the yin-yang symbols on the South Korean flag comes to mind  the one curving left  but was narrower. In all five or six formed  each growing onto the upper right side of the circle-like cloud. After they were all formed the cloud became more oblate  squarer with rounded corners. The envelopes formed sequentially  the first beginning from the 12 o’clock position. Each one was growing on the lower edge of the preceding one. The tear-shaped envelope is a sort of bottle. Next  I saw contents of the bottle growing from the smaller back at the edge toward its larger front at the port. It’s growing into the space rather than filling into it. This is a biological process and how it grew was amazing. The process took only a few seconds to complete each teardrop envelope of its contents. Growth would suddenly appear in discrete steps  not gradually filling within chambers of the envelope. I saw its compartments being filled in. Each cell of the envelope is irregular in size  shape  and volume. It reminds me of compartments of a complex soap bubble  itself being formed of bubbles within the biggest bubble. The inner bubbles are the cells being filled in a flash-instant of growth. There’s a tiny pause  then the process moves to an adjacent cell. The progress of moving between cells reminds me of how water drops suddenly connect together moving down a dry surface. Just a tiny hesitation before they merge. The next one would get its space filled  and so on until the envelope was totally complete. Each cell was filled with different stuff; some of it was light  some was darker color. The only thing coming to mind that’s similar is tadpole jelly from the swamp I played in as a kid. As each envelope filled with growth  a new envelope was immediately traced out under it. It would fill and so on until all of them were complete. The envelopes developed in a clockwise stack under each other  the last one being grown at the five o’clock on the cloud-circle. When the processing was complete the cloud-object changed its character  getting bigger much faster. It changed to greenish-yellow from gray-green …more yellow now. Next it began coming  moving rapidly down to us. It traveled the 200-250 yards in under three seconds  closer to two. I was startled to have it come so fast but I wasn’t scared. As it came  it changed the angle of descent twice. It started down steeply and changed to half the angle at half the distance. Within the last 100-feet it changed again by half the angle  arriving with a shallow slope only slightly above us as it swept in. As it came I saw the cloud was 3X taller than wide  luminous but not bright and without distinct features. That is  except for a perfect black ellipse centered in its upper third  the major axis at vertical. The cloud was symmetrical about its vertical. That is if you could fold it in half  both sides would match exactly. The black object seemed like a tunnel in the cloud  like a big eye  but wasn’t. I searched hard as the mist approached  looking for any definition but saw no detail anywhere. The elliptical feature disappeared without me noticing as the cloud arrived. I feel it’s there merely as a focus  a diversion but nothing significant. The cloud was strange-looking  much bigger than us but wasn’t itself a creature. At its edges I vaguely recall seeing separate forms the instant it arrived  the kind of thing you can see if you don’t look directly at it. They came so fast I couldn’t focus my eyes fast enough. It’s like they’re on each side of it  the landing party of workers sent by who’s ever in charge. I’m thinking This is my chance to see something …but no way. Another interesting point; the light cloud approached low over water  yet I saw no reflection from the water as it came. It’s low enough near the end and I should have seen it. But it didn’t happen. For a year the subtlety escaped me  as in  what’s wrong with this picture? What sort of light is that anyway? I know that Joe saw the cloud come  too  because as it arrived he hollered No! Joe felt threatened  and anyone would trying to hold onto normal reality. Here is his only known world. Something like this has no place in ordinary life experience… does it? As the light cloud swiftly engulfed us I felt nothing different. We were immersed in a yellow mist. I struggled to see something  anything. Then looking down and to the right I saw motion. Something smaller was moving toward Joe. I saw a small person like a five-year-old shuffling past at a half-run followed immediately by another exactly like the first. I only saw them from the belly down. The glare of yellow light was masking everything. No one came toward me. They went toward Joe  standing to my right four feet away. Besides their size I made two other observations of them. Their knees are simpler  the same thickness as their thin non-muscular legs. Their knees are nothing like our thick knobby knees. When they run they don’t lean forward enough as we do. Their backs are nearly straight. Nobody runs like they do. I’d fall down trying to run like that. I’ve imitated their posture trying to make a step but couldn’t move. I’m thinking they’re really lightweights. Their upper bodies are minimal. As I watched them go I’m thinking There’s no sidewalk over there. They loped past about three feet over the edge of the sidewalk  out over water. Their loose silvery metallic-looking clothes glowed from the surrounding mist  but less bright than the light. How many came I don’t know  I saw only two. But an interesting thought comes to mind. I’ve seen bodies of these workers being custom grown  all six of them. A biological process happened just before they came. Seems they use such bodies to work here with us  like we wear our jeans and jacket. If it’s so  what technology! But it makes a guy speculate about what form they’d normally take  to assume biology-wear as a work suit. It’s what happened. The mist was a nuisance  I couldn’t see much. I looked carefully at what there was to see. I remember looking at the bright yellow light source at floor level. The bright object was lighting the cloud creating the mist. It’s on the ‘floor’  parallel and even with the edge of the concrete sidewalk but beyond water’s edge about four feet. The light’s a half-ellipse two inches high  eight inches long. It’s the mechanism making a platform under them  extending over the water where they’re working. The light had bright radials sticking up from it in the vertical plane and was located parallel to the edge of the concrete sidewalk. I saw the bigger radials of light are separated at 20-30 degree angles from each other  bright from the source and quickly becoming less distinct  fading a few inches above source. Radials would all shift together at irregular intervals  hopping back and forth  yet holding their places and distances to each other as they all jumped to another position. My impression was  it’s compensating for load dynamics on the platform as the workers moved about. I closely studied this light show until I understood what it’s doing. I looked up and forward into the mist thinking Now  what next? Then I felt I was going… Going? It’s really subtle. No weight off my feet or of being uplifted  but a feeling of departure  upwards. Then… blank. I was blanked for a time  because next I remember coming to  realizing I’d been blanked. I was again conscious  present  feeling some air. I seemed to be back on the sidewalk where I’d been. My body was still standing there just as before. I felt the gentle air from the canal. My eyes were still closed  although I felt I could open them if I wanted but didn’t. Seems  somehow I knew we weren’t finished yet. I heard a slow vibration  about 8-Hz  like a flutter. Then quickly it’s gently against my forehead. In a moment it went in. It’s inside my head! It was not interfering with my mind  I could still think. But I’m being buzzed by a wave  a gentle  extremely low frequency (ELF) wave… thinking What’s it doing? ELF wave was getting harder  slowly rising in intensity and in frequency. I felt like it was charging my brain  like a capacitor  more  more  and more. It kept on increasing  the frequency going up  up  ever upwards. On and on and I’m thinking Will it ever end? …knowing it’s going to my limit and wishing it would find it soon. But it kept going higher  higher. How could it go so high? I wasn’t happy with the wave continuing upward. It’s tough to take but it went to an unbelievably high level before finally hitting my limit. It abruptly stopped with a pop at the top of my head. Receiving the buzz was an extremely rude experience. I was grimacing  eyes and jaws tightly clenched to withstand its powerful effect. There’s never any pain  just a force. When it ended  I got released and it doubled me over spinning me around clockwise. I saw Joe’s feet where he’d been  still standing next to me. I shouted What the hell was that? Damn! …thinking I am back. Have I just landed on my feet? … I’m on my feet. It felt strange being back  like where had I gone? Physically I don’t feel I went anywhere. I was zapped hard by something and was afraid  thinking Maybe I’m ruined. It’s the most physically stunning experience. I staggered around a long moment  10- or 20-seconds  trying not to fall into the canal. I was cursing trying to get a grip on reality  trying to get my balance. Everything’s distorted  nothing making any sense as I look around. For once I’m scared  thinking I might stay this way. The wave was forceful and its release was like having grabbed a 240-volt AC line… new meaning to the word stunning. It also cleared out my thought processes but not where I live in my mind. That part was still unaffected  because I was myself the whole time. Rude as it was I still had the glad feeling like before. Maybe it’s all in friendship  and if so I’d hate to be on their other list. Good time  is it? The only thing coming to mind was that they’d given me a capacity test  taking a measurement. But Guinea pig? There’s obviously nothing else it could be. Finally I was coming out of it  looking around for them. The disk was moving away  flying over the canal a mile to the east. It made a curious maneuver  a small move to the right to back over the levee. But it did so in a spiral motion  first moving left then rolling in a downward circle coming up to the right  all the while keeping its horizontal axis parallel to the ground. It’s a victory roll … way too odd! I’m thinking Someone’s got a real sense of humor in there. Their job clearly has some humor in it  watching me deal with effects of the Buzz. More than coincidental  the maneuver was for my benefit  because I understood it as a wave goodbye… the little buggars! They had to know I was looking  like they were watching through my own eyes somehow. But what’s the relationship and why so friendly? Well  I’d actually discover why four years later. There’s more ahead about them  you’ll be impressed. It’s easy for me to see their maneuver  because my eyes were so slowed down. My eyes were now like a video screen  with light-paint lingering  delayed in a sort of light-smear  tracing out its path as I watched the craft circle moving back over the levee. I was thinking Fishermen at Nubbin Lock are getting a big surprise as this thing flies low over them …right …about …now. I laughed to myself about it. Shortly later I looked toward the Nubbin again  still getting my bearings. White lights all looked very yellow now  blurred …even smeared. They’re much bigger than usual although not brighter. What seemed different was  when I moved my head  the lights smeared to over where I was now looking. Then the smear slowly faded. Also  I had tremendous night vision  almost like day. I could see everything around me  up and down the canal. Everything is clearly lit by a yellow light glow. There’s more. I also had eagle vision at will. I could will myself to have a close-up frame of any object I wanted to see. It would simply appear closer and bigger. Such total surprise! I stood looking at things in a residual yellow-light effect. I could see better by it. The light cloud was gone  of course. At the time  there were very few lights down the canal and not big. But that night they helped light up the whole canal. Otherwise it’s blackness down there when there’s no moonlight. I enjoyed my newly given ability only briefly  because we were washed out and tired. At that point we stopped looking and went inside but soon came out  again  for another look. I saw the disk glowing brightly two miles down  still near the levee. Back inside the house it was drab  really dull and uninteresting after being outside seeing things. Artificial light so close to me inside was annoying. My vision had changed. I was sensitized to see by different light and its effect is awesome. If the Army only knew that a directed ELF produces fantastic natural night vision. Fat chance though  that they’d make anything happen like this in a hundred years. It’s modulated ELF. We sat in the house a few minutes saying nothing. I felt so different than normal  like being at arms length from myself. I could still think but I couldn’t scan-think  like in thought synthesis. It‘s the processes needed for reaching conclusions. Thoughts wouldn’t flow in that way. Then without discussing it we headed for the bedrooms. I threw myself down on the bed and stared to the ceiling  trying to rethink what happened. In the pitch-black room my new night vision didn‘t help. I couldn’t see. Next  it’s morning …a dreamless sleep all night. Like flatline  there’s nothing in my head. I woke up rested with the event first in my mind. Again  Joe and I didn’t speak of it the whole way to Boca. It’s perfectly ridiculous  but we’re keeping the same ‘secret’ from each other. It’s too taxing to discuss  besides I only wanted to relive it privately. By that night my special night vision was gone. But my eyes played tricks concerning eagle vision. Sometimes it’s in  sometimes it’s out. It gave me problems driving  because scanning for traffic in the mirror sometimes a car seemed too close  nearly on top of me. Seconds later  it’s back to normal. The car was where it should be. It’s annoying and dogged me for days. Weeks passed. I’m rethinking the event everyday while driving. Gradually more and more came back and I wrote everything down. Finally I had it all except for being blanked. That part wasn’t recovered… if I got my ride after all. As a result of the encounter  Giroux wrote four books with the information they gave him in astounding detail.  Those books are self-published on Amazon.com  but are still essentially unknown works.  The titles are: I AM DARIUS – Awakening I AM DARIUS – Special Knowledge I AM DARIUS – Divine Family I AM DARIUS – Expectations Recently all four books have been collated into a single 8.5 X 11 volume of 562 pages titled  “Divine Paradigm”. Divine Paradigm is a compendium detailing the “big picture” workings and purpose of our existence and the interconnections and multiple levels of reality itself.   The contents of these books provide the rationale for our lives and the answers to questions that mankind has been asking since the beginning. This work is the ultimate UFO-Bible connection story from a modern day Enoch.  It provides the background and rationale for all other historical and biblical “encounters” as well as those continuing today. The elegance of the truth is stunning! Giroux  now a retired in Okeechobee  Florida  was a successful mathematician and statistician for over 40 years. He received a BS and MS in Mathematics from the University of Massachusetts  Amherst and pursued a doctorate in that discipline at the University of Pretoria in South Africa.

481,I’m not even certain that what I saw was extraterrestrial  it could very well have been a black ops project.  The craft had bright and very fast flashing lights underneath  and it must have been traveling extremely fast considering the distance up in the sky.  But the weird thing was after a few minutes it completely disappeared and there were no visible clouds.  Also there was a full moon that week.   I experienced this phenomenon on four separate occasions during the week in question.  I don’t have a video camera so I can’t offer any evidence of the sighting.  Yet  I don’t normally report things of this nature either but the fact that an aircraft disappears right before your eyes got my attention.  Thank you for your time and the opportunity to report these experiences. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: oubliette@rock.com
482,The lights were at the same elevation throughout.  They went back and forth rapidly (too rapid for a plane).  There was no sound.  I was with my mother and two dogs.  The dogs started barking.  We went back to our cottage.  When we tried to open the door it was as if the key was melted.  I had to climb in through the window to let us in the house.  There was never anything in the paper.
483,clear blue  sunny sky…over wooded area. No military bases or airports close by. Near Wando river. It was 55 F outside at the time
484,we were fishing at the jetty in Santa Cruz really nice day and as i looked up North of me with my back too the Ocean i saw what appered to be a large milar ballon it had a silver shine to it and it was just still not moving in the wind. my kid and his friend were asking me were too cast and saw that i was gazing up ward both turned side ways too there left and saw the same thing  did any one else see this??
485,It was a red glow  it hovered for a few minutes and then flew off behind a cloud. I thought it was gone went in house for a minute  went back out and it was in the same location again and did the same thing  then the same scenario a few minutes later.  The third time it was closer and hovered longer. When it flew off you could clearly tell it was some sort of aircraft. I have never in my life seen anything like it. I have a video.

486,I was only about 3 or 4 years old when this happened  so my attention to detail wasn’t terribly acute. My memory of the experience seemed so odd however  that I checked with my mother to see if this actually happened  and she told me yes – my memory is absolutely accurate.  Anyway – I remember my mother holding me in her arms as she stood on the elevated back porch of our house in LA (I think we were living in Venice at the time). Hovering about 80 feet off the ground was this huge  round  air-ship-type-thing that my mom told me was a blimp (it wasn’t). I’m not sure how long we stood there  but as daylight faded into night  it commenced to entertain us with an amazing and lengthy display of multi-colored lights; glowing neon polka-dots that danced across the entire surface of the darkened hull in ever-changing geometric patterns which my mother describes as ‘psychadelic’.  As I was a very young child at the time  I remember thinking that the display looked like an enormous ‘Light Bright’ toy – only the lights were able to move and reconfigure into countless different shapes and colors in rapid succession  and seemed to be seamless with the ship’s ‘skin’. Unlike a blimp  there was no discernable navigation cockpit on the underside  nor was there any other apparent compartment  where someone might conceivably sit or stand in order to maneuver the craft.  My mother’s memory agrees with me on this. Also  neither of us recall there being any sort of engine noise at all. There may have been a very faint hum/vibration  but from what I remember  even though it was hovering probably less that 100 feet off the ground  the craft seemed to make almost no noise at all. I don’t know what the ship’s movement might have been like as I don’t remember seeing it arrive  and my mom took me inside before I could see it leave. When I asked her about this  she said that her arms were tired from holding me for so long  that it was past my bedtime it was chilly that night  and since it seemed that the ‘blimp’ had finished it’s light-show  and was apparently not going to do anything more  she decided that it was time for us to go inside.  For whatever reason  although my mother agrees that what we saw was definitely impressive  she’s never felt that what we witnessed that evening was all that extraordinary. She never bothered to investigate – nor did she even speak with any of our neighbors about it (for that matter  no one ever came to our door to either).

487,Seen something strange in the sky last night 10/13. I live near Ft Lauderdale Beach area. Seen a bright white (star like) object moving through the sky  no blinking at all and quite obvious. It was moving from the South to the North. So I knew instantly it was not an airplane. I called out to my partner to come running out to see. We both watched it so that I can confirm I wasn’t loosing my mind. Then as it moved across the sky it took a sudden turn to the right (going east) over the Ocean –  very sudden actually! Suddenly the light turned to a solid Red color and became small then suddenly shot into the sky. It gave the image of going up into the stars. It appeared as thought it was shooting skyward away from Earth very fast! It became so faint we could no longer see it. Then about a 1 year ago as I was taking my dogs in to the backyard to do their business. I always have a habit of looking skyward as I always have since I was a small child. Suddenly I seen a triangle object with NO lights at all  in fact it was “very  black”   slowly moving over our city. No noise what so ever  again no lights.  It happend to be a very clear night and as I couldn’t take my eyes off of what I was seeing it appeared to be very high up and gave the image of being very large. As it passed over I seen it black out stars as it passed so I know for sure it was close enough to earth. I watched it for about 5 minutes as it slowly moved in a complete strait line toward the direction of Miami. As a child growing up in the Desert Southwest both my family and I were always seeing strange things in the sky and I suppose has made me that much more aware of things that normally shouldnt be man made in our sky. Thankfully I can honestly say  it wasn’t always just me seeing these objects but friends and family on numerous occasions. I would be happy to share my other stories. Thankfully I found your website and wanted to share my two recent experiences. Should you have any questions. Feel free to contact me. I would be glad to share more.

488,Myself and 4 other people decided to take a trip to an abandoned army base on Friday the 13th in hopes of seeing something ghostly  but we encountered something totally different than what we had ever expected!  We all were standing on a hill witch over looked the whole army base I had asked one of the people there what time it was due to the fact I only had a baby sitter for a certain amount of time. The time was 10:20pm.  All of a sudden we all felt the ground vibrate and could hear the sound of the vibration and the direction it was coming from(SOUTH) we all looked that way then out of nowhere this huge light that was VERY bright and blueish in color came and shined almost right in our faces hovering it did not move.  I just remember standing there in shock not being able to breath and frozen  weather I was frozen in shock of what I was experiencing or for what ever reason. I have no memory of how long I was frozen or how long the sighting lasted  but it was there beaming in our faces and then just disappeared with no trace of anything ever being there at all.  I do know as soon as it disappeared we all freaked out and ran down the hill and jumped the nearest fence to get out of the army base. When we had gotten over the fence I had asked what time it was again in worry that I had gone over the time limit that I had told the babysitter that I would return home.  It was 10:40 we had lost 20 minutes in time? That is the question we all have to this day  where did the time go and what happened while the 20 minutes went by?  I have told my story a few times since the experience  but I get crazy looks in the disbelief of my story so I just keep it to myself.
489,Let me exsplane  In the last two years out of no were i have been obsessed with ufo’s  contact reserch anything that has to do with it. I have always senced there were other beings hear on earth  like a fealing that will not go away  but i would just shrug it off  and move on with day to day life. But now i am having memory dreams of them  like my sixth sence knows something is coming  i feal like a dingbat saying all of this due to people thinking i am off my rocker  maybe i am oh well. This has become very seious to me it is naging me like i should get ready for somthing to happen  and i have a strong sence that our frends who have been hear on earth for a long time has set this up for us to awake.  i know that this sounds off but i would like to know how many other people have reported this fealing and or type of day visions or night  i do not mind others contacting me just so you know if i think that they are off there rockers i will lett them know not to bother me.

490,
491,It was in September of 1967 in Ct. I was about 14 and no one at home but myself  I was ironing and all of sudden all the lights went out in the house. Thougt it was electrical problem  but looked out window to see if it was just our house. It was the whole street I lived on.  I stepped out on back porch and it was so bright. I looked up and a triangular object was hovering over my house with NO! Sound at all. It had lights all around. I could see underneath of object. Had a lot of different objects on it.  I don’t know what they were .  I watched it as it slowly left  all the lights went back on. Never told anybody until years later.
492,No sounds I was in my first year of college decided to do my paper on UFO situation with Roswell. Started feeling a little spooked afterwards. During this time the whole Kentucky was shut down due to the extreme winter weather no one could go outside it was life or death cold.  I went to a neighbors who stayed on a top floor to hang out. They looked out of the window and looked away in horrid shock. Then I looked and all I remember is the metallic disk colored lights hovering over us. don’t remember leaving the apartment we tried to figure it out like all the other sightings Military radar  meteorologist no one saw anything except is regular citizens.
493,THIS SHOW LASTED 20+ MIN AND AFTER ALL WAS SAID AND DONE (THE LANDINGS ACROSS THE VALLEY FROM ME AND MY FRIEND (WHO SAW THE HOLE THING AS WELL)  WITNESSED A BEING POSSIBLY LEFT BEHIND FROM THE LAST VISION THAT HAD APPARANTLY LIFTED OFF AND DEPARTED SLOWLY UP AND THROUGH THE VALLEY TOWARDS THE NORTHWEST  (again without a whisper).  After the show was over we both heard a roar like grown from across the valley and with that  a cold wind rushed up the hill where we had been observing this episode. Time to go down and home ? –  I guess ? If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: michaelm1258@yahoo.com
494,IT was reported in the florence morning news i cant remember the date.
495,Sitting at the dining table we noticed an orange glowing light outside. (We live on top of a hill looking south towards Mt. Tamalpais and SF). We went outside and the glowing object just hovered for about 12 seconds. No sound. Looked to be about 7 000 feet up maybe closer. Planes in the sky were much smaller (higher up) and blinking. We get a fair amount of air traffic. this was not a plane. Then it got smaller and smaller until it disappeared in the horizon in the direction of SF. We watch planes disappear on the horizon and it takes about a minute or two. This took about 4-7 seconds. We went back inside then about 4 minutes later my son said “It’s back” It was in the exact same position in the sky. Lingered a bit longer this time then disappeared once more in the exact same manner and in the exact same direction. My husband got a picture of it. Was it a Chinese lantern? We googled on pictures of orange objects in the sky and it looks very much like a Chinese lantern. Except it wasn’t moving and gliding along the sky  it was stationary  it appeared higher than a lantern in the sky and disappeared or faded out more rapidly than a lantern that would be taken by the wind.  Can’t figure this one out. Never have reported or seen anything before
496,I have seen it several times  others suggested it was a satellite. but why would it emit a beam towards the moon  and have lights that make it appear as a star would? One time I got a binoculars  it disappeared. Usally early pm and early am it is in the sky over orange  towards Derby ct. I live near an active air space for Tweed airport but it avoids that area  and pops up suddenly when things are quiet in the sky. I have never had any interest in UFO’s but this is peculiar. it is sneaky. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: canide@gmail.com
497,I do have trouble writing this but people must know. I first saw a U.f.o in my hometown of Spiro OK and it was in the year 2003 the object i seen was toward the AR border it was 9 lights that resembled the Arizona lights. I only recently found the similarities in them  it came back several times that year and the following 2 . I have only recently seen odd lights again not the same ones but Maybe 2 weeks ago they started first it was the one light (white-orange glow)  with a sort of upward downward motion and then it would fade away. It came back for a week straight only never in the same position and around the light and near you could see jets flying past it and circling back i believe i counted 12 in one night. Then following this i seen 2 orange lights appear then flying northwest to south east then faded out in the middle of the sky! They came back three nights in a row  now i have been looking at these same stars since a child now i have noticed a light to the northeast maybe 2 miles in the sky toward the AR border  another directly east Near AR  And 1 more toward the south west. Now i am very freaked out by this sudden increase in activity and also the fact that this lights are obviously not planes or jets or stars (they are too low and bright)to be stars. please if anyone has seen these lights i would say in LeFlore county or Pushmata county southwest sky . plz let me know im not crazy.
498,Clear night with lots of stars visible. Noticed bright light overhead and watched for about 2 minutes as it moved southward.  There was no flashing or colour.  Assumed it was a Satelite but then it stopped moving and the light dissapeared almost instantly. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: bburrus@rogers.com
499,Its moving fluidly and many directions
500,I don’t know what it was  but I am not aware of any man-made vehicle with the capabilities that I witnessed. This he second time I have seen objects of this nature in the same location. The first which was over a year ago was more unexplainable than the one mentioned above. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: craigp572@gmail.com
501,objects moved very fast i was about 11 or 12 years old. another time 1987 me and friend were sitting outside it was dark about 9:00 or 10:00 pm. we looked up at stars we thought they changed colors one green one red they were up in sky pretty far apart  they took off up higher met next to each other took off very fast side by side.
502,I was walking my dog and heard a plane flying over head and looked up  i saw the plane…then a series of 6-8 maybe even 10 Llights ascending directly overhead.   My firzst thought was it was a flare of somekind.  It was too high in the sky for that…and they all followed the exact same path and dissapeared in the exact same area of the sky.  Completely silent and a realtively straight flight path.  I tried to take a video after i realized what was going on but it turned out really bad
503,I saw this bright white light that pulsed  and as it pulsed it got bigger then after about 3 or 4 pulses it vanished as if it was never there.
504,It seemed to pause in same area  though it may have inched along.  Hubby and I watched it for a good minute.  Sometimes one light  sometimes two.  Orange mostly.  Light(s) vertical  diagonal  horizonal movements.
505,My daughter woke up on two occasions last night describing several red orbs passing above our house. By the time I was able to see for myself  they were far in the distance but still visible. Again at 4:30am she woke up describing the same thing and this time their were white orbs as well. I was unable to catch a glimpse this time but she is very convinced. Just trying to find out if anyone else saw anything last night.
506,saw them in waves of eight and some on there own but they flew in formation and single ones on the out side of the formation in one line there was eleven but they all were flying at the same speed and it lasted for half an hour starting at midnight and ended at 12.30 we phoned the police but they said nobody had reported any sightings but we were talking to our friend on the phone she lives in Royton OLDAM and saw the same formation as we did passing her house around the same time If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

507,No sound  no movement If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness (Optional): stargazer1359@yahoo.com
508,panned left and did not break formation If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: sazsjmorris@yahoo.com
509,Observed for apox 1 min with possible smaller orb at same level as the first object. when almost reaching it the two amber colored lights vanished..
510,The light hovered  moved at a fast rate  stopped  then disappeared.  It stayed still for around 3-4 mins.  No blinking lights were on it  just a red glow.
511,My husband and I were camping on the shoreline of the reservoir. We are very familiar with the area and go there often. There was enough light in the sky to be able to see the outline of mountains against the sky. Around 10pm  we noticed a sparkling white light which we first thought to be a plane  then realized it was moving all around and could not be a plane. Also  there was no noise.  Secondly  we noticed a different light which pulsed red and white  very rythmically but in various patterns.  Both of these lights would move  disappear (go dark) and reappear. This was all happening on the front of the foothill (not going up and over the backside that we could discern). They would hover  move a little  move slowly  and also move very fast and in a straight line.  They both kept doing this for some time  and then were joined by more lights. We recall seeing up to four lights at once: the white sparkly one  plus three red/white pulsating ones. We had binoculars  and through them I saw four perfectly shaped crescents (like new moons) lined up in a very straight diagonal  moving down the slope of the hillside.  The bottom one turned red  then the rest began to glow a little redder  then the crescents all suddenly vanished. At one point we both noticed that one of the red/white lights was getting bigger and brighter. Without sound for reference  I felt it was coming straight toward us. My husband feels it was just getting bigger in place  but we agree that it looked bigger.  The lights were bright enough to shine on the water. Toward the end we also saw some green added to the colors. There was no sound until the very end of a 30 minute period  when we heard a thumping or whirring that reminded us of a helicopter. We heard this for a few seconds at most  and the lights all vanished immediately  along with the noise. We did try to get a video  but there wasn’t enough light to record it with our iPhone.  Instead  we have 3 audio recordings of ourselves documenting the event while it was occurring  plus a daytime video of the area (for perspective) that I recorded the next day. We estimate the lights were about 4 miles away  straight across the water. The next day we talked to another party camped on the same side of the lake  and they confirmed that they’d seen it too  and also heard no noise. The next weekend we camped in the exact same spot. Husband asleep  I watched what I thought was a satellite in the sky overhead. But I noticed it was changing direction and literally would do U turns  move all about in a squiggly way  and sometimes move in a straight line. I watched this for a very long time (I tried to wake him up 3 times to see this) possibly an hour or more  when finally it ascended straight up until it was out of sight. This light was white until it ascended  at which point I noticed a faint red and green along with the white.
512,I was walking the dog at around 10:30 am and looked up to see a very large metallic object flying soundlessly overhead gliding eastward at about 15 000 to 20 000 feet  and at the same time I heard a helicopter to the west and saw several commercial jets with contrails flying at higher altitudes going cross country.   It was a very large square shaped body with rounded front with a shiny finish that reflected the sunshine. Then I realized this was a UFO sighting!  I watched until it disappeared to the east. Unfortunately I didn’t have my phone or a camera with me.
513,Big bright flickering orange. Slow moving.  Flew east across the Carquinez Strait. Then turned south toward Contra Costa County. It faded in color when it turned  away. Then it briefly came back around.  Then it went away. This was NOT an airplane…
514,I have seen this ball fly over 5 times in the last year.  Tonight  I was taking out the garbage and noticed it again.  It looks like a beach ball of glowing goldish light.  It crossed my vision from the N. West flying S. South west.   It started overhead at a rapid pace  slowed down as it approached downtown columbus just to the west of the City and completely stopped.  I noticed it around 8:00PM  and it is still sitting there.  It has moved slight west since then and is emitting a greenish / redish spark from it.   It is not an aircraft.  I fly myself and have a vast knowledge of commercial and military aircraft.  This thing is emitting no sound and has no anticollision lights.   It is Still there just west of downtown. Columbus.  It was also followed by a more dim object which zigzagged across the sky.  Starting from the same area. Turned Norther zig zagged over the Final approach beacon for Port Columbus and from there I lost sight of it.  Again this is not an aircraft!

515,I was sitting on the beach around 10:15 and saw 3 balls of red-orange light form a triangle.  They all flashed on in sequence then turned off in the same sequence  with each light only lasting 1-3 seconds
516,While watching fireworks  we spotted a blue dot in the sky that would sit stationary and then zoom to the left and then back to the right. The closer it would get the more of a rectangular shape the light took. It would get very close  low  and bright then disappear and reappear 1-2 seconds later much higher in the sky. The way it moved was to erie to even discribe.
517,My friend and I were walking down Mount Olive Road when a beam of streaked light (much like a meteor or shooting star) streaked through the sky. The beam looped in the sky twice before shooting down towards the ground at an incredibly fast speed. Faster than any plane could possibly go. It was extremely bright and had a blueish glow around it. It did not reach the ground and crash  it vanished out of the sky.
518,On October 20  2011 I was walking up to my friends house  and i noticed a bright orange light i the sky  but when i looked back it was gone. I knew i wasnt seeing things so i stared in the area that i seen it come from.  I stared for atleast 5 min  then i went to go sit down with my friends  i didnt want to tell them what i seen because i didnt really know what i saw. A minute after i sat down  the light came back  and i pointed it out to all my friends.  We stared at the lights skim across the sky from a distance  at times it jumped the sky like a rock across water. Then we seen one of the ships light all the way up. The shape was a saucer and it had six lights around the whole ship.  It lit up for about five seconds  then just dissappeared. the lights would come then vanish into nothing. When i was the first one that saw it i didnt wanna say anything because they mite have thought i was crazy  but when all my friends witnessed it too..i feel alot better about it.

519,I was on a night bike ride following the Boise River headed west. At 2300 hours I stopped at a bridge to take a breather  I noticed an aircraft with a triangular shaped light pattern; the lights were white in color and did no flicker. The altitude of the aircraft seemed to be about 15 000 feet based on movement and relative size. The AC seemed to be descending at a NW direction at a 45 degree angle; it then stopped and headed SW at another 45 degree angle in my direction. As it approached and got closer  I noticed that it did not have the typical red and blue strobe smack lights or directional indicator light that is required by the FAA.  By this time it descended to about 2 000 feet. I thought it was odd that it was on approach toward the ground since there is no free airspace for landing. At this point I thought it was a reconnaissance plane or a government aircraft and I went on my way. About 15 minutes later I was returning from my trip crossing the same bridge and an older couple on bikes stopped me and asked me if I saw the same aircraft. The man quickly asked me then stated he and his wife saw it come on approach then come to a standing hover about 1 000 feet in the air  over a lake next to the river trail  and next to a clock tower.  He then stated in a rather shook up tone that he and his wife then saw it completely disappear  not just shut off the lights but literally vanish.  He said  “I think it was a UFO  no I am certain it was a UFO!” He gave the same description and saw the same vector as I did just from a different angle. He was coming from a grocery store north of the bridge. I told him I saw it too but shrugged it off as some sort of air craft  knowing deep inside that I kind of thought the same thing; I just didn’t want my imagination to run away with the idea. I have to say now that I had another verified witness and I watched most of the decent  that I think it was one too. One thing that I noticed was it’s odd light arrangement and the color  dark grey it moved in a rather strange pattern as if it were no propelled by lift or jet propulsion; due to its complete lack of engine noise  it simply just changed course. An aircraft of that size  that of a small jet liner should have had some kind of noise associated with it  it also had a smoother tighter angle of decent. At that point I realized the man was still carrying on about his sighting  I interrupted him mid sentence  partly because I was creeped out by the thought of seeing something so strange but   also because he was so concerned and disturbed with his sighting. The wife seemed to be in shock. I told him I was going to go have another look for myself   the whole time thinking crap  how am I going to get home? As a departed he called out  “Hey  wait a minute weren’t you listening there is a UFO over there you should go the other way!” He was right I was stupid to head in that direction but I had to get home. When I arrived at a good vantage point  I carefully looked at the sight but there wasn’t anything there  or at least nothing I could see. So I headed home – the whole time I kept glancing back and looking for any traces of the craft in the sky. Man what a night!
520,There was no sound heard from the object.  Also seen by 3 others who thought it was a air transport because we were at the local hospital. But when we got out of our cars  there was no sound and the object had vanished.
521,it looked like a bird at first  but then it didnt look like it had wings and moved in all directions. Looked like it had a translucent circle around it. Seen at around 515 PM EDT from parking lot of a store near Bear  DE
522,Was walking girl friend to car. Saw what I thought were jets flying in a V formation because of five or six green lights then noticed it was one large black object with strange green lights on the botton (not after burners) moving quickly. Pointed it out to girl who saw it also not as long as me though. No blinking lights. Bigger then any plane I have ever seen yet silent. I am LDS and a honest person. Truly an Un Identified Flying Object.
523,"On August 3rd of 2010 me and my buddy left for Vegas from NJ. Driving thru Nebraska we have stopped at nite to look at the Sky’s it was about 2am.  About 30-45min later I have mention to my friend while driving about 80mph what is that way back behind us about 5-10<15 miles  away (cant tell since it was very dark and only us on the road at this time) back with a huge bright light going towards us "" is this a bike   what is it? its going to hit us its going super fast !!!! ""  We both look at it and it seem to us like we were standing still while the other object was moving at speeds that our way beyond driving of any objects i have and him ever seen. I even mentioned please pinch me and tell me maybe I am just tired and maybe need to pull over … He replied no i see same shit man …. this object pulled at super speed towards our car within a 1-2 foot distance VERY CLOSE!!!   We didn't what to do at this moment…we looked thru the mirrors since the car was packed and the light brightened up the whole car (98 clk 320) and we could see the reflecting light bouncing back the sides of the object about 3 feet or more to each side..This object was following us for about 30sec within 2 feet away .  It disappeared behind us by dimming the light out completely and just disappeared . We pulled over in 5min later shaking and scared to sleep for the nite in 5 disbelieved what happened that nite and till today have a hard time understanding it. I would never ever drive thru Nebraska at nite again!!!!"
524,I was walking through my field  and saw the UFOs in the sky. The one in the exact middle dropped the cylinder  and then I picked it up  and the triangular spacecraft came down. This beam of light came from it and focused in front of me. After a few seconds  a creature appeared in that light. It was shapeless  and spoke in some sort of clicking language. After a few seconds  it pointed to something  and it started speaking English.  It said: “You are special. You have something no other primitive creature has on this primitive planet. You are the only one intelligent enough to build the craft that will allow you to travel through space. You will be the one who will cause the Wakening.” and then  he dissapeared  and the spacecraft took off. Does anyone know what kind of spacreft this is  or what alien  this is?

525,Was outside at 8:30pm something caught my eye to the SE. Upon looking up I saw a chevron shaped light source. As the object became close the object was not single but several amber lights in a loose formation.  Some of the amber objects changed position but as a whole remained in the chevron shape. The object  or objects were high altitude  leaving not trail or emitting no sound. the number of objects appeared to be anywhere from 30 to 35 individual amber lights.  Encounter time was 30 to 40 seconds allowing time to judge direction and approximate count. I am familiar with various aircraft types  satellite observations  meteor showers and various astronomical object locations. I have never witnessed anything of this size  number and formation If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: iamateachatecms@yahoo.com
526,I was driving home from school and I saw a bright white light. I was talking on the phone but I still noticed it and mentioned it to my friend. I actually thought it was a star at first. I noticed it at the first light in raymond coming from windham. It looked like a star because it wasn’t moving.  By the time I made it to the second traffic light  I got a better look. Still just a bright light before the traffic light changed to green. I am stopped in my car looking at this thing  talking away on my cell phone  what I thought was a star moved straight up.  It had two lights lights light up during this time and it looked like it wings. It was just starting to get dark out. It really stuck out to me because there was no stars out yet and it was a really bright white light. Could be nothing but it could be something  who knows? I wish I took a picture or video taped it on my phone!
527,i was looking in the sky and seen what looked like 2 planes and as they got closer it looked like they were going to cross each other( I’m facing toward like north west i think . and one plane  was coming from that way and the other was coming from the east) as they got closer i stood up to look at them as they moved and it looked like something that looked circular and had  red and blue lights ( more blue than red)spinning around it on top of it kind of like how an electric banner is but it was just the lights no words or anything. it looked like it crossed right under the plane that was coming from the east.
528,Traveling bloody fast! Have googled everything I can think of and no one else appears to have seen it.  I was not alone so have a witness.  We are both bamboozled as to what it could have been.  Too fast for a jet.
529,We caught a bright oval object in our wildlife camera at night in 4 different photos over 40 minutes. Couldn’t be the moon because the camera was pointed NNE  and the object moved NNW and didn’t change in altitude. Zooming in on one of the photos  there is series of brighter dots on one edge. Photos included. Let us know what you think. We’re stumped.  If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: cliffordscott6@gmail.com
530,I was driving on I-15 heading south just past the Bluff St. Exit and I saw a dark metallic saucer shaped object hovering over the Southgate golf course. It was slowly moving north then started to bank and head east. I had to take my eyes off of it for a split second to look back at the road because I was driving.  when I went to look back it had vanished. It was not close to the horizon or anything so it didn’t go to where it wasn’t visible it just suddenly disappeared. 3 others where in the car with me and witnessed the same thing.

531,Saw Balls of light that flikered on and off and reapeared in diffrent areas of the sky lasted approximetly 20 to 30 seconds a known aircraft of some sort looked like it was tracking these lights tried gettin cell phone recording of these lights by the time i got it up and running they were gone nothing left but the human aircraft in the sky If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

532,it was very far at first. only saw the red glare then it started flying down fast but not fast enough as in crashing. it got so close I saw the actual round disk then it landed in the woods. me and my friend looked info the wood from where we were 5 minutes later and there was a bright white still light. there are no houses in the middle of those woods.
533,Im just suprised no one ever reported this. i was following my father inlaw to rt 84 when he sudddenly pull over and got out of the his car  I got out of my truck. what seem strange is that there seem to be a large crowd that gather around us.
534,Very strange light was orange with red almost plasma like very bright looked like nothing else in the sky it was a clear night.It looked as if it was coming down when I first saw it but I believe it was coming forward and it made a smooth turn to the to my left (north)and flew off until we couldn’t see it anymore.It was moving at a steady but quick pace  no fast movements.   It made a sound as it was flying a quiet steady woosh as if it were pushing air .There were planes flying not close to it but off in the distance to compare it to along with stars in the sky. We got a great look at it I also had a friend there that saw it.After a few mins. of trying to figure out what it was I grabbed my phone and tried to take a picture and I got a small bright dot agianst the sky by the time  took the picture it was pretty far off. I haven’t told many people because the ones i’ve told look at me like I’m crazy.I don’t know what it was and neither did my freind I’m not saying it was an alien i just dont know or have never seen anything like that in the sky before .
535,I was on the second floor looking up and saw it I froze a good 7min mom said a big round shaped burn mark was in their back yard. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: jjeanchristine@ gmail.com
536,I have only told a handful of people in my life this information since I saw this happen in the sky when I was 9 years old  so please understand that this is very difficult for me to type down for others to read  but  I also realize now that there had to have been others that witnessed what I did  so here goes.   My sisters and I had been outside playing in June 1966  I decided to lay down on a camping cote we had outside to rest a while and my sisters went in the house.  As I was laying there for a little while I was looking up at the sky and I noticed there weren’t any clouds out but the sky was a beautiful blue  then at the same time from absolute different directions I saw these objects flying in the sky very high up  as they approached each other their speed slowed until they were close but they did not touch.   I laid there watching this happening wondering what in the world is this  the two objects just sat their by each other for 1-2 minutes it seemed like at the most and then they flew off back in the directions that they each had flown in from.   When they were flying in to meet they’re speed didn’t appear so fast but when they took off it was so fast  it seemed like it only took a second or two and they were both gone back into the directions (1 from the North and the other from the South sky) they had come in from. This happening was forever etched into my brain  I have never seen anything like this since but the memory of that one occurrence will forever be with me I know as it has never left my memory since  and now  that I’ve let others know via this sighting description  I feel better  so Thanks very much for reading about my UFO sighting. Through the years since this happened I have read  watched and listened to others share they’re experiences  and until I came across this internet site I never thought I’d ever share this incident with but the few I’ve confided in  but for some reason I was compelled to share this information with this site  so maybe there’s a good  reason  I don’t know  anyway  hope you have a great day and Thanks again for listening  (in a way I guess!) — Trude If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

537,Around 8:10  it was dusk and I was sitting on the steps of boardwalk looking at ocean.  All of a sudden a bright yellowish/orange light appeared in the sky over the ocean.  Much closer and brighter than stars.   Only a couple very dim stars were visible as it wasn’t quite dark enough for stars to appear.  One light up very bright and then faded out after approximately 1-2 seconds.  Another appeared right beside it in the same fashion and faded  then a third and fourth.   The all appeared and were all in a perfect line in the sky equidistant from one another except for the 4th.  The forth was a little closer to the the 3rd and slightly lower.  It was as if they were along the edge of something and the 4 was slightly around the far corner.   a few seconds after the 4th lit and faded a 5th lit and faded in the same fashion right below the line of 4.  CRAZY!!! Searched for videos around myrtle beach and saw similar things but nothing that had the exact same formation or pattern as the one I saw.    I’ve never seen anything like this and make fun of my wife all the time for being so interested in this type of thing.  All I can say is that I feel very fortunate for having witnessed  it and certainly hope I hear from someone else who saw it! If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

538,very weird  hard to explain writing it to someone but me and my buddy sat there and watched it and it was no air plain.
539,My friend had just got to my house  and I had just walked out. Everything was almost still and very silent. I felt the need to look up and there was a huge bright ball of light. It sat there for a second  then shot (faster than any plane or jet) to the left and just disappeared. It was crazy  and I KNOW it wasnt just my mind. This thing was real  and made me feel awesome.
540,It was April the nineteenth of the year two thousand twelve at around 3:00 to 3:30 and I saw something in the sky so I pointed it out to my mom too and she stopped the car. It wasn’t as high as the helicopters that going to and from Fort Campbell  It was about as high as the small private planes fly.  At first I thought that it was just a smoke cloud from a fire but I looked back up at it after looking away for a second because it wasn’t a light charcoal grey color like the smoke clouds normally are  It was a light brown with an orange tint to it like the smoke from the core of a fire. It didn’t have wisps or smaller shapes around it and it looked solid not like a cloud at all  especially because of its shape.  It made no noise that I know of (the windows were up and the air was on). It looked almost like a rectangle with very small curves on the ends and looked two dimensional because I couldn’t notice any sides to it. It looked like it was moving from west to east (We were facing north) but it was getting smaller and vanished so I assume it was moving vertically of my position and not horizontally like it first appeared which means it was traveling northeast.  If it was traveling this direction I should have noticed sides to it but it looked like a rectangle so that’s why it looked 2D. The object was clearly visible and there was nothing connecting it from the ground and it was (from my view) a few inches above the tree line. There was little to no wind today and the sky is a crisp blue without any clouds in it.  It’s a quiet day as well with no lawn mowers or any other noises  only birds singing. I didn’t get too recorded or photograph the object. When we got home I got on my motor bike to recover any further or to see it again but I saw nothing but large and small birds flying around  a U.S.A.F. Helicopter  and a small private planes flying around.
541,I went to leave late and saw the object above my house hovering  it stayed for a minute or so and moved off.  When I returned home maybe 30 min. Later it was back  hovering for a about 5 minutes  moving up and down. It had 4 bright lights flashing. It again moved off. I again came out of my house an hour later to walk my boyfriend home and it was there again  and it followed us all the way to his house.  I live really close to writt patt but it just didn’t move like any jet I’ve seen. The whole time it made no sound. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

542,Near sunrise  clear sky.  I was looking due east.  A very very bright object streaked across the sky  traveling far faster than any airplane.  It was moving purposefully  in a straight continuous line.   Its color was a most brilliant greenish yellow  and it glowed uniformly throughout its path.  It appeared to be in two sections  connected  but I was so surprised by its unexpected appearance that I failed to be a sharper observer.   I am an early riser and frequently scan the eastern sky  but I have never  ever seen anything like this.  Should have reported it sooner.
543,My mother brother sister and neice were sitting in a parking lot getting coffee when the looked up and saw five silver objects puffing out smoke which looked like morse code.they would appear and disappear and left what lookd like two patches of “morse code”i doubt thats really what it was but thats the closet thing it resembles.i have two pictures she sent me and in one of them it looks like there is a little spheriod object in it.very interesting for sure.first time reporter
544,im 64  college degree and outdoorsman all my life.visiting my grandkids in arlington log cabin. left after ranger game. driving back to my wife at weathervane motel in manchester  on rt 7A at 10:45 notice glow out of right pass windsheild. pulled up to gap in pines and saw this glowing perfectly moonlike sphere.  was perfectly clear night.turned off interior lights  moved car another 10 ft and looked again at entire sphere. then again for few seconds at third gap and realized i was now on grass. turned car steer wheel back on road looked back and had vanished.saw for about 25 secs total. turned car around went back to where saw glow at first and nothing more.  went to motel looked for moon all around. told wife. went to police in manchester in morning. then back to my sons cabin  went on computer to see there was only a tiny crescent that night.  i dont know why this happened to me.completely dark and clear. why me when millions of remote areas there? was i the wildlife being observed? i am very uneasy and nervous. trouble sleeping a few night. i just dont know what to do or think since. spoke to director hayden planetarium who asked me questions and his final remark was”neil i think u have seen what me and my colleagues have looked for our entire lives” thanks for any response If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

545,Traveling southbound the radio got very statically  and when I went to adjust it  an object caught my eye just breaking over the tree line. It was going so slow I couldn’t believe it was in the air. It didn’t make any sound  there were white lights on the underside  none on the side and back. The side and back looked…industrial…like the sides of a battleship. The “front” was the “pointed end” and kind of reminded me of a “mosquito face”  and held what appeared to be an “observation deck” or “cockpit” if you could call it that…  It passed in front of us about 1500-2000 ft away  over the road right above the trees from our right going left. It had what appeared to be strings of kelp hanging from it and barnicals the size of buckets stuck to it. I couldn’t help but think that it was underwater for a long time. It appeared to be “hugging” the tree tops the entire time  disappearing beyond the treetops on the east side of the road. We tried to get another vantage point but it was gone…I swear that it went into one of those lakes around the Alamoosic lake region. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

546,On November 30  1998  my husband and I were going to Fredericksburg  VA. He was driving and I was reading a book. We were on Rt. 2 and when we were almost at our (L) turn to go to I-95 at Thornburg  my husband said  “There’s your flying saucer!” I looked up and it was just sitting there above the trees and a couple of houses. The shape of it was like the combination of a sideways diamond and a sideways oval. I wanted him to stop so that we could watch it and see what it would do  but he was afraid to stop. I kept watching it and writing down everything about it so that I would not forget any of the details. It had no doors or windows  but it had white flashing lights at the top and the bottom that flashed with green ones at the two ends  These alternated with 4 red ones  two on top halfway between the white and green ones and two on the bottom like that  that did the same. It was like a ‘brushed metallic silver with light/glow from within. The sun had gone behind the trees so it was not a reflection on it from the sun. Every time we had a clearing  or were on a hill it was still there. I saw it all the way to Thornburg and every hill on I-95 until we started descending  and then  because of the trees I could no longer see it. A couple of weeks later I found that my camera was in the trunk; I could have gotten a picture of it! On the right side of Rt. 2 is A.P. Hill  a military base. I’ve wondered if it could be a secret military craft of some kind. Other people surly came north on this road like we did  and anyone driving would have seen it for sure; but I guess they didn’t report it  just as we didn’t.
547,I took about 20 pics and I have never seen anything like it before.  so of them look back but if u have high end video card u can see it some times u have to look at the screen at an ang.  If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: easy6633@yahoo.com
548,nothing I can recall to compare it to
549,
550,There were several.  Looking through my binoculars the object was darting from one location to another as if to turn a light on and off.  Then it would moving in a figure 8 type movement.  The lights were very distinct with yellow blue green and white.  Could tell shape because of the distance away.  The figure 8 movement was very distinct.

551,I was driving home when The full moon was up in sky. Then sudenli appears 2 disk sized craft in sky so the moon was behind them. Like the Water gathered around their vehicles. Ther was a trees and when i saw it again then the wind was ripping the clouds appart. It was reallly strange. In this place is the millitary radar. maybe they saw it to..I dont know.
552,Fast travelling orb   very bright ; brilliant even. tracked from Southen high overhead aspect until out of sight over South/Westerly horizon. Constant speed and direction very much like a satellite but 100 times more vivid and unmistakably quicker than the usual velocity shown by the nature of observing a lot of  satellites. Very original observation as this is the first time I have ever felt the need to communicate the veracity of a sighting .. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: n/a
553,Two objects emitting bright orange & yellow colors passed directly over Hershey – no sound. The objects were in a loose trail formation at an altitude likely greater than 10 000 FT. A third appeared about 5 minutes later flying the same track. They were not airplanes  nor did they have position or anti-collision lights.  I am and have been a professional pilot for 36 years. These aircraft were something other than any aircraft type that I’m aware of. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: paturks@juno.com
554,I was traveling on route 8 coming from Naugatuck when I had seen the red light in the sky. I ignored it for a bit because it was a starry night out  so my first impression was that it could be a planet  star  or airplane. When I reached the beacon fall area  I got a better glimpse of the red light. It started to move straight down pretty fast and then disappeared. The two cars in front of me braked and slowed down as well because I can see both their heads starring to the right where the object was located. Shortly after seeing the object vanish  a pinkish color shade of lighting lit up the sky with no sound of thunder. I wasn’t intoxicated  high off any drugs  or on medication. I and the other cars on the road noticed the light drop in the sky at the same time. A recent sighting of weird lights in the sky has appeared in Bristol  CT on June 22nd and was on the news. This was my first time seeing something like this in person and was slightly freaked out. I don’t know what is going on lately  but weird things have been going in in CT.
555,I was coming home just before 9pm. Parked my car and looked up at the night sky like I always do.  Very starry and clear and bright. Looked up to see this VERY BRIGHT WHITE triangular object moving in a south easterly direction away from the city.  I stood and watched it for some time ( 10 minutes) it had no flashing lights of any type  I have never seen anything like this before. I know it was not a commercial aircraft. I see lots of those day and night around here. I had never seen anything like this before  that is what caught my attention.  No batteries in my camera  so no pics dam! Anyway I am just curious to know if anyone is reporting activity in southwestern Ontario in that timeframe. I will be watching more now for sure. thanks
556,Over ocean beachfront traveling slow
557,I was outside for about 2 hours when im leaving my friend a voicemail while this happened but were no longer friends  I Look up  and see 2 MASSIVE GOLDEN EAGLES FLYING WITH FLAS LIKE / LIQUID MOTION (wings) and theyre about 2 feet apart and get closer as they leave my view. It was my most questionable sighting yet. Ive had 5 sightings and saw 7 ufos  these are two. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: bobgalba@aol.com
558,I had just observed what I thought were new stadium lights over a vacant  field along SR444 and was continuing home. As I came up Hunter Road I was stunned to see something flying above Hunter Dr (a cross street) at a very low altitude and moving very slowly.  I already had my window open and could hear nothing at all.  It was not a helicopter or small plane. I was so startled I stopped my car and turned everything off.  I watched this object which was about the size of a small helicopter cockpit move very slowly across in front of me. It continued over a field to my left. I waited until I was certain it was gone and hurried home. It had a pointy front and was rounded in the back. There was no visible means of propulsion as there were no propellers or engines. I only saw a side view and it looked to be shaped like an egg on its side except flat on the bottom.  It was moving about the same speed as a jogger.  There was a small beam of light from the bottom pointing down at an angle. At this point I realized the “stadium lights” I had just viewed were probably a large ship and most likely associated with this low-flying craft.
559,We were outside and it sounded like a farmer in the field cutting corn. The sounds were like a corn chopper. But it was in the sky 1000 feet up and stopped and turned because I had a large flashlight that I was pointing at it. Then it turned north and keep going. It was black triangle and no lights at all. It was just getting dusk and sun was setting within an half hour so seeing it was getting harder. Very strange. About 6 of us were witnesses to it. we had no pictures no cameras to get to from our location. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

560,seven triangular orange-pink lights rose up vertically in the sky one after the another!!! If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: sappersandy.1@gmail.com
561,it was a bright light moving round in a circular motion.  It hovered right above the clouds continuously moving in a circular motion.  It lasted more than 30 minutes.  Distance is unknown  as I was looking at it from my second floor bedroom window.   It looked to be the size of a beach ball  if holding it right in front of you.  The sky was partly cloudy and rain was in the forcast  but it hadn’t started yet.  The wind was blowing just a bit. grabed the video camera to record what I was watching.  I have the video  and have been trying to find someone who can clean it up so that it can be view better.
562,We saw 3 large orange lights in sky from house window  then a 4th. Ran outside and saw a 5th  but then the first 3 disappeared. The the 5th and 4th blended together then seemed to shoot off to the NE and disappeared. There was no sound.
563,They usually stay in the sky  or moderate distance to the ground. Sometimes they have flown low. They have lights as a terrestrial craft would  yet make no sound  even when flying low. They preform maneuvers that are impossible for any known aircraft to preform. (90 degree angles  vertical flight)
564,I saw about 20 of the orange spheres  there looked to be a flame with a lighter color orange inside the circle. No flickering. they were evenly spaced out one after the other (30 seconds or so after the other) they flew pretty low  but far too fast to be any sort of balloon. There was no sound of an engine. Appeared to be ascending and all moving in the same direction. 4 witnesses.
565,Since October 15 2010 during the nights my wife and I are always coming home late. And every night we are seeing ufos in the  sky in the Woodbridge Mannsass area of Virginia. Its been incredible!!!
566,As I was watching fire works with my family we all noticed a bright red  small round object slowly gliding across the sky.  At first we all thought it was an airplane but then we noticed there were no flashing lights and it seemed to be too high for an airplane.  After about two minutes of watching the object glide it stopped and hovered in the sky. It was hovering for about a minute until the light started to slowly dim and then it disappeared
567,Saw something similiar last night traveling on 80 west around 7:15ish somewhere near the clevland exit. Saw 3 what looked like plane entrail going west. The top two were really close and then merged to one. The one below got smaller and smaller. There were two orange dots closer to the ground that also merged together. The top 3 dissapeared and minutes later the bottom ones were gone. Looked like this: * * * * *
568,Wondering if anyone else saw strange lights over Cumbernauld at about 00:50 this morning. I stepped out to my garden and was looking at tbe stars.  I saw what appeared to be a triangular object made of red/orange lights heading south east First thought was that it was unusual for a plane to be leaving Glasgow airport at this time. However it suddenly turned east but lights remained in same formation. Another set of lights came from north then both disappeared.  No noise and too high in sky  and controlled to be lanterns.
569,It comes out of the volcano. Can see it from my brothers house in Alerce. 10 miles north of Puerto Montt. Usually in the summer months. It swings like a pendulum for a while  then it stops and takes off faster than anything ever watch. Usually dead animals and the sort happens at the same times the lights come out.
570,i went out at about 830 pm    as i looked west i noticed what seemed like a huge star that seemed to be blinking– i went in to get binoculars and then saw the most beautiful lighted geometric show ever!  days later i saw the first one in the same spot again  this time it seemed much farther away and harder to see
571,looked like stars at first but with odd twinkling colors to them.Hovering way above the tree line but 2 were closer to the ground with one changing colors and another shooting off towards High Point Monument.

572,4 large globe shaped amber lights appeared and did not move for about 45 seconds at which point they faded to 3 then 1 before disappearing altogether. 4 other people witnessed this event. This occurred near Market Commons about 45 degrees off the horizon  due East. The total event lasted about 90 seconds. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

573,Still there  have been looking at it for about 30 min   turned on video camera and heard a low ringing and camera would not work the ringing lasted for about 6 seconds and dogs were barking   I have a very good camera quite new and it did not work at this moment.  Sound weird right?  It could be satellite? I wish I had a scope
574,I alway’s look up at night… and I focused on 3 star’s cause i thought they were dimming in and out…and moving a little.But than they started to move a lot..one went one way and the other the other way  the third one almost down than they all stopped and didn’t move anymore..I kept looking up and than all theses little light’s …they looked like stars..started moving around and comming out of no where.disappearing than reappearing..than another light comes traveling thru these light’s and it get’s brighter and brighter  and i thought that one could be a falling star …shooting star…but than it lost it’s brightness but it was still visable it never burned out it went by fast than slowed down it kept going lost it the further away it traveled.  So weird and neat to see…i’m gonna be outside tonight around 8;45 again cause that’s when it happened…..so neat!
575,I was out side with my 2 kids waiting for school bus when i saw a ball of light float by. so i told my daughter and get my camera to try and take a picture. here is what i got.
576,I was on my way to catch a bus as I did every morning and always hear the channel 4 traffic helicopter and I look up to see it. Well i did and I saw the ufo and it saw me I stopped walking and it stopped I started walking looking right at it and started moving slowly as if it was moving with me I stopped it stopped this happened about 3 times then i ran to catch the bus I was on my way to work. I no that helicopter saw everything.
577,It was the evening of July 4  1984.  I was stationed at Castle AFB  located in Atwater  CA.  On this evening  after all the Fourth of July celebration  myself  wife and our 4 small children went to the nearby lake looking for a small toy my toddler son had misplaced there.   While there  my wife suddenly asked  “What’s that?”  Looking up into the night sky  we saw a glowing fiery object streaking across the sky.  Being in the Air Force and stationed at a B52 base  I suspected what the object could only be….a nuclear warhead.  Turning to my wife I said  “It won’t hurt.  It’ll all be over in an instant.” As we all embraced  I glanced up to see the object separate into two glowing pieces.   Both streaked across the sky then  as if a miracle occurred  they both seemed light up brightly then slowly fade away.  On the way home  we listened to all the local radio stations and were amazed at the number of sightings people had reported.  The next day  I inquired at the base what those objects were but never did actually find out.   I was wondering if anyone out there has ever heard of this or actually knows what it was we saw that night. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

579,Looked out my window and seen two huge v’s in the sky web outside and it did a light sequence twice then moved slowly for about 30 seconds then just disappeared.  2 mins later 2 fighter jets came and searched the sky. We could hear the engine of UFO it was like small rumbling noise.  Nothing like the sound of fighte jets… This is the third sighting I’ve had and first time reporting it. Haven’t seen ufos this upclose it was like it was getting ready to land in my front yard!!!
580,HEADING SOUTH ON 89S AROUND MILE MARKER 18 RANDOLPH VT IN T.T.I SAW ALARGE BLACK WING SHAPED LIKE A PARA SAIL MOTIONLESS JUST APPEARED TO BE HOOVERING OVER THE RIVER JUST TO MY LEFT AND ABOUT 150 TO 200FT ABOVE THE HIGHWAY DIDNT NOTICE ANY LIGHTS OR MARKINGS THIS WAS ABOUT 10AM PARTLY CLOUDY MORNING.
581,I was sitting outside with my Dad having a drink and sky watching. For an hour or so the only moving things in the sky were outgoing and incoming airplane traffic. Then at around 11:15 i pointed out a bright white orb in the sky traveling Northwest. Instantly we both knew it was not a star or plane because of how fast it was moving and the orb did not flicker  flash  or have any airplane details like red or blue lights.  My father and I both had our eyes clearly on the orb  and followed it for about a minute until it got close the Little Dipper constellation then it disappeared. Both my father and I saw this disappear at the same exact time. We started to discuss what it could have been ( my dad was not a big believer  until now) and we came up with 3 possible explanations: either it was a sattelite  a NEO  (near earth object or meteor) or it was some sort of UFO. My only question about the satellite explination is I was under the impression that satellites usually travel in orbit with the earth and this orb was going against it. This orb also didn’t fly in a complete straight line it seemed to manuever (slightly but visible) to the left when it got near the handle of the Little Dipper. At midnight my dad went to bed but I stayed out for more sky watching. Around 12:30 on Sunday morning  I glanced towards LEO when I saw the same exact orb traveling in the same direction  north-northwest. This time I was determined to not lose sight of this orb. The orb was the same size and color and seemed to be just as high and moving just as fast as the first one. The only difference’s was the first orb was near the Little Dipper (more in the east sky) and this one was near Leo (in the western sky) and this orb didn’t disappear as fast  i estimate I had 100% visibility of it for close to 3 minutes. Again this one eventually just disappeared when it got closer to the constellation  of Virgo. My mind was racing with possibilities and honestly I thought these had to be satellites because even though I know there is extra-terrestrial life in space  seeing 2 UFO’s in one night has to be pretty uncommon. Then came the 3rd one. Yes  a third. This was an exact replica of number 2  same spot  size  speed  direction. Everything was exactly the same except it only lasted about 1 minute before disappearing. This could have been because i didn’t see it as early as I did the 2nd  i don’t know. I welcome any questions  comments answers  and even rebuttles on this. I will be posting more occurences as they happen. I also now permanetly have my video camera plugged in and charging outside  where I sit when skywatching because I am going to get this on video when it happens  and it will  again.

582,I was watching my dog in the yard do his thing when I was watching the night sky  at 1st this light looked odd cause of the brightness  we have to many city lights to see stars that bright  as I stared I notice very odd movement in this “star” it would move from right to left  north  south… the clouds were moving north east but It was moving in the oppisite way… when it would fade lightly  others would swirl around it… it did this dance about 3 times before fading away… it really gave me the creaps cause I’ve never seen anything like this… but I know what I saw & it wasn’t of our world… If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

583,2 UFO’s across from each other.  One was shooting beams of light toward the other one.  They were both hovering and I could hear a humming noise.  My camcorder was not charged and my my phone was not able to take pictures. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: katgordo@yahoo.com
584,Headed north on hwy 7 at around 7:45 p.m. On Monday * September 19th  2011  saw pulsing light that was brighter and bigger than any star. It went directly overhead. There were pulsing and multicolored lights that were on the underbelly of the object as it hovered and jumped long distances in a split second.  Object was seen by others and one in Frenchport  AR. It was close and had two panels that really lit up bright among the smaller colored lights. It traveled a great distance in a mater of moments. This was a real craft and not hlographic. I felt a funny feeling when it was overhead. I felt like I was in it’s feild or wake.  Best visual I have ever had up close. This is important. I got that sense too. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: jamesrandallsmith@yahoo.com
585,object moved across the sky at aprox. 38degree angle off the horizon. it moved in and out of my view in 35 to 45 seconds no sound and a stright line
586,I was standing on a deck early evening and notices lights in the eastern sky. The only reason it kept my attention is because it was traveling so fast. I can not remember if it was one or more objects.  Then  it stopped for a while and seemed to be hovering. Which I thought was really odd but because of the distance I wasn’t sure so kept watching.  This was high in the sky and at a great distance away so I didn’t see shapes or anything but what made me feel like I saw a UFO is that once it began to move it appeared to go practically straight up like a bat out of hell.  Im no physics expert but the way the object departed at an angle that did not seem consistent with modern aircraft as I understand them. Until the day I die I’m convinced I saw either one of mankind’s fastest  most advanced plane or something from another planet.  This is coming from a guy that grew up in San Diego near Mira mar air station where military planes come and go at all hours.
587,Orange lights tha slowly appeared moved in non-linear patterns then faded away/ Always in groupings. Group of 5 that appeared were in a straight line evenly spaced and stayed in sight for 5-7 seconds before dissapearing If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

589,Laying down looking for shooting stars at first I thought it was an air plane but then it wasent making noise and it never blinked and then it went west like a shooting star but very slow.  Then I saw 2 different Crafts interacting in some way about 2 or 3 miles out those went south east at the same time one slightly behind. Then we saw it appear out of no where and it looked like a bird but very bright an white and it went about 5 miles to the east in about 7 sec.  I was with 2 friends and we just got back from watching. Sorry about grammer spelling and things like that was typing fast so I don’t forget If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

590,Came up over the clouds and traveled upward on a curve.  Shape was like that of a circle and/ or balloon.  Traveled too high and too fast to have been a balloon.   Shone like a star as it traveled further upward and then remained still in one spot for over ten minutes  continuing to shine light in a star-like manner.

591,On the deck at roughly 1045 last night.  Just happened to look into the NW sky and notices a number of lights (10?) in a boomerang formation moving in a SE direction.   It was moving at a good rate so didn’t have time to grab a camera.  It almost seemed to be shimmering as it moved across the sky.  It took 20-30 seconds before it was out of site.  Two others saw it with me.
592,It was in the summer of 1973 I was 11 years old on summer break from school. I woke up in the middle of the night and my bedroom was lit up bright as day in a very strange blue glow. There was a faint humming noise present. I looked at the clock on my nightstand and it said 2:45 AM.  I became scared and ventured into my parent’s bedroom where I saw the both of them standing in front of the window looking outside. I remember my mother saying “What is it?” My dad saw me and told me to go back to bed. I began to cry because I was scared to death. We all moved to our living room where there was a picture window that looked out to the back of our property  which was on 3 1/2 acres of wooded land.  We could see a very bright blue light shining  through the trees back in the woods that could be compared to the brightness of a welders arc.I will never forget the sound this thing made  it was a humming noise in a very low key that tickled the inside of my ears. The duration was only a few minutes and suddenly you could see this thing rising above the trees and it was gone in an instant  as our living room went black.  Well…needless to say  none of us got any sleep that night. My father was afraid to report the incident  as he did not want to be labeled as a crazy person  and I was told not to tell anybody what I saw  for the very same reason. That same morning when the sun rose  my father and I walked back in the woods together to have a look around  and to our surprise there was a clearing with a tree knocked down  and the leaves on the ground were scorched in about a 30 ft circle.  If you were to draw a square around the circle  at all 4 points  there was an indent pushed down into the leaves also scorched. About 20 feet to the left of the site was an area I was always warned about as a kid. It was a 6 foot hole in the ground  maybe a sink hole?   I was always told it was an old water well that was dug by native Americans. I used to throw things down the hole but you never heard anything ever hit bottom. My father always feared it was an accident waiting to happen so he used to throw large branches and wood debris over it so no one would  fall into it.  The interesting part of this story is the fact that the hole was uncovered  as the branches and debris were strewn everywhere. The only other thing I can recall from this incident was my father saying to me…”Don’t tell your mother”. I have never been quite the same since… I am a true believer  and only a few people have ever heard this story.
593,When looking south I saw something that looked like a roman candle in slow motion then went back to one solid ball which then faded in and out. Then 3 or four single lites traveled to the west to out of site. This all took about 3 or 4 minutes. I only have video of the portion of this siting were it went back to one ball and faded in and out a couple of times If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

594,I was out riding my horse with my Two sisters when a very Bright Florescent Pink Teardrop shaped image appeared in the sky.  This was not a firework display even though It was sighted the day after 4th of July. We spotted the craft in the eastern sky just over the Sacramento river about One mile away from where we were.  It appeared for about 5 minutes just hovering then disappeared.  It then reappeared but farther south kind of following the direction of the river then disappeared again. A few minutes later it reappeared  but this time it was much closer headed towards us to the West.  It just hovered there without any noise for about 5 minutes then disappeared once again. The next time it reappeared  it was even closer to us and was so intense that my sister and I became so scared we took off in a dead run on our horses to get away.   I remember reading the paper the next day and seeing an article in the paper about a UFO sighting in Europe. The Article described  the UFO  as being teardrop shape which sounded very similar to what my sisters and I had witnessed.
595,We were driving along when we saw 3 orange objects come out of the tree line. We stoped the car I got out and try to take a picture. I got one of them but the qaulity is not very good. There was absolutly no sound. They looked like floating campfires. Moving at steady speed. They just faded into the night.
596,4 persons witnessed at the time….i asked a friend what are the two stars close to each other….at that point both objects were at at standstill..my friend looked up as well as others and one of the stars zoomed away out of sight…..i dont think it was a satellite or plane because it was at a standstill and then zoomed north of the star out of sight…my friend who has knowledge of stars is befuddled also….this happened during the fireworks a long way from the “stars”
597,Was in backyard  my son and friend were in front yard  he yelled for me to look in sky  it was to the east moving south in a strait line rapidly with no noise and no chem trail.  I yelled to the lady next door and she also saw it and could not identify it. There were no wings or sign of any engine.  I HOPE OTHERS SAW THIS OBJECT AND COME FORWARD! Also my camera on my old flip phone is too crappy so no I could not get a picture  people would say its fake anyway.
598,Object was coming towards me at about the same speed as a commercial airliner  it had no blinking lights  and made no sound as it passed by. It was not a helicopter with a search light. This was just unbelievable. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: jakeblacksky@yahoo.com
599,I go out with my binoculars at night to look at constellations  planets  and view the moon at different phases. these were something i have not seen before. looking at them by eye they looked like a small triangle of three lights. They were in a pattern in the sky  many of them  and they all looked the same. I looked with the binoculars  holding the binoculars against my step ladder which i can use to keep what i look at from shaking. each one when looked at with magnification were like a saucer shape  it moved on an axis  and had close to it another very bright white light. Each of these looked exactly the same. I counted seven or more. some were on to the east  others to the west. They are not satellites  satellites move like a dot slowly east west or (polar satellites) north south. and they certainly weren’t anything else i have ever seen. I personally don’t care if anyone believes me. i know what i saw. i don’t even really need to tell anyone  except  since it is so odd i thought i would. i am going to check again tonight. i went over to the neighbors and they looked up (weren’t too enthusiastic) but they saw them and thought it was “odd”.  oh well. go figure. Maybe it was weather balloons. or maybe they came here to listen to WLFE our st albans country station. Heaven knows no one else listens. bye. You probably think i am nuts or making it up  but i am not. I don’t think i will talk about it to anyone. Koo Koo keith
600,absolutely silent moving about 150-200 knots. over a 8-9 minute period they followed a path. some were single some were by 2’s and 3’s. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: rjconklin012@yahoo.com
601,I saw  bright stars in the sky  I’ll try and illistrate what i saw  because it is too hard to describe *<planet  *ufo      *Ufo *ufo        *ufo       * ufo *planet    *UFO           *ufo The lights flashed  disapeared for 5 seconds  flashed again  disapeared for 5 seconds  flashed and were glowing bright for 20 seconds  I ran in the house to wake my dad up  when we came back outside  all that was left were these black smoke looking clouds where the ufos were located I was to in AWE to even think to snap a picture. So therfore there is no evidence. But I swear on my family I saw this today If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: jimbohowell88@yahoo.com
602,I was on my motorcycle headed east on 198 when I looked up. It glared in the sun  that’s why I looked up. As I kept looking up at it  it shined bright  traveled a few inches what it looked like from that distance and vanished.  I wasn’t sure what I saw but the sky was very clear that day and I know jets just don’t vanish into thin air. Also there were no vapor trail that jets leave at that altitude. Anyone else see somthing like that on or around this day?
603,I ran out to play  my father was staring at something in tbe sky  when I approached him  he pointed to the sky and asked what I saw.  Being young and not aware of UFOs  I got bored as they did not move  went on to play.
604,when i saw it the first two times i tested if it was a star by watching it for about 1 hour then went inside  when i came back out it was gone but stars around it still there  freaked out i went in to call freind went back out 10 minutes  later it was back .the next completely clear nite same stars but not ufo star didnot come back for weeks but other stars around it where in almost same spot  but no ufo star   now its back with totally new stars around it is it a satellite or space station  or a UFO??

606,My boyfriend was driving me home after watching Monday Night Raw (around 11:45pm) 2/27/12. Normal drive  taken it many times  day and night but out of the corner of his eye he saw something strange. Not many other cars on the road that night  so he slowed down so we could get a better look at it and see exactly what it was.  Towards his left (driver’s side) he saw a normal plane  looked like it was heading towards Philly  but miles below  almost directly below it was this strange object that seemed to hover in the air. At first we thought it was a star until we got a better look and noticed it was keeping up with the speed of the car  not going too slow or fast. Still up in the sky  but much lower than the plane.  It wasn’t generic plane shaped. It was a solid black triangle mass  with 2 pulsating very bright white lights coming from underneath it  (1 light on each corner). It made no noise when it moved  unlike the sound of a plane  no jets could be seen. We eventually pulled over  both fixated on the object  almost trance like.  A few moments later the object took off with a quick burst of speed and was out of our view  we turned down the street and not more than 5 minutes later saw and heard a single jet black helicopter take off in the same direction. We have no idea what we saw but had a creepy feeling about the helicopter.  Never saw any type of “ufo” before so I’m not sure what to think now. **Note  my bf said he saw the same object near his work in Cherry Hill again  hovering in the sky tonight  3/3/12.

607,Looked almost like a meteor but was going very slow and steady. Gold very bright star ball shape object. Didn’t seem like it was very high at all  Flew along the N11 going South before turning South West.  Seen at Bray Exit to Greystones\Woodies up to shankhill turnoff the N11. We turned around to go back and check but it was gone.. We observed it for 40 seconds.
608,Was driving to work about 5:05 am saw this trail of light and it titled to the side  saw the round shaped object in the sky and then it dissapeared.
609,came in slow  thought it was a meteor off in distance  hovered for a second then went south and up at a 45 degree angle pretty fast  didn’t make any noise at all
610,On a Sunday evening around 6:00 still daylight  I believe late July  I was running bath water and looked out the bathroom window toward Pearl Street in Metuchen.  Pearl Street is bordered by railroad tracks  and there is an American Legion in one corner of what is now the Pearl St. parking lot. A movement in the sky caught my attention  and I saw a dull silver oval-shaped object moving above the tree line along the railroad tracks from left to right  slowly.  As I called my mother to come look  another oval object came into to view heading from right to left – toward the first one. They were on an equal level and moving slowly. They came to within a short distance of one another  paused a moment  then shot straight up so quickly and were gone – as if jumping into hyperspace.  Although I don’t think the words warp speed or hyperspace where used at that point in time. My mother never appeared in time to see this  so I was the only witness I’m aware of.  Coincidentally when returning to Franklin school that September  my home room teacher had a photo thumb tacked to his bulletin board of the same type of thing. I asked him where he saw that  and the reply was “over a reservoir I can see from my backyard” I believe in Union.  Years later I wrote this teacher and left a phone message requesting a copy of that photo  and although I know he was still around  never received a reply. Needless to say a lot of time has passed and I know what I saw was something that will stay with me as truly a unique experience.
611,I can’t recall the exact day and month but what i am sure of is in the year 1990  with family visiting from out of town  we all were in our pool until the early hours of the morning.  At a very fast speed and very loud rumble  something huge flew across and over us lighting the night sky to day  it was low coming out of nowhere  almost skimming over us. After passing  we heard hundreds of birds cherping and dogs barking. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: adriana292@msn.com
612,At approximately 9:25pm on the 4/6/2013 3 formations that resemble round objects where in the sky (close to or above the NSA Base Panama City Beach Florida. The distance approximation less then 3 miles from Boca Lagoon and NSA. The round objects where at the time of the sighting red on the top with a silver ring and below the silver ring red  green  blue revolving lights. The objects stayed in the air approximately 15 minutes in an upside-down transverse L shape pattern. The first object moved to the north then despaired. The seconded object moved to the north by north east then diapered. The last object moved downward then to the north by north east and slowly moved out of sight.

613,The craft had bright red lights that illuminated one by one then faded out. The strange illumination caught my eye for a second before fading out.( I was  overlooking the ocean from my hotel room balcony.) Assuming it was a plane  I laughed it off.  Within 10 minutes the craft returned and I pointed out to my friend. About 6 rows of red lights illuminated again one by one before fading out and disappeared.
614,was traveling from ny on 206 comming into greene ny.  looked to my left and saw for a split second a round object gray in color  big.  it looked like it turned or banked to the left and came above the tree line.  it was light out and it scared me silly.  i havent really told anybody about it.  wanted to see if any one else saw it to.

615,When I look northeast in the sky I saw this large very large white light in the sky  at first I thought this was a large planet till I notice it was heading right towards me but it was moving so slow.  As it came closers I notice one very large light in the nose of the ufo and two white light on the belly  its right above me…huge I mean huge moving so slow I could ride a bike an keep up with it if I had one.  no sound at all and flying so close to the ground an then a second one flew over same as the first still no sound. try to take a pic with my phone but it was dead. 15 min later my phone is working.
616,Was looking out of my window and noticed a low flying large object that obviously wasn’t a plane or helicopter. After it flew out of view  I noticed a metallic object hovering in the background. I thought that the world was coming to a end. We ran out and tried to get a good look  but it was hard with all the trees around. That is the first and last time I have seen a UFO.

617,2pm  blue skies  no clouds. I saw something that I thought at first was an airliner passing by very high. I saw 3 or 4 that day with the fine smoke line behind. I was washing up my house roof. I noticed that the object  which was as high as those airliners  was flying at an incredible speed (there’s when I really focused) and there was not white smoke line behind.  It suddenly changed direction to northwest and after that  stops for 2 seconds and went backwards  made like a Z movement and then regain its west direction and disappeared in the blue sky going up up. I couldn’t define the shape  but it reflected the sun light like metal reflects  like a strovo light. I could see that better when it was passing over me.  That night  I went to bed at midnight  and I herd a small plane (monomotor) flying over town  I guess in circles  because the motor noise never stops for 3 hours. I also herd a jet passing by each 4 or 5 minutes for the same 3 hours until my wife and I went sleeping. ???? If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

618,I was driving up highway 204 around 6 pm. There was a storm coming and lightning was flashing. It was nearly dark. As the lightning flash lit up the sky  I saw in front of me  up high  a saucer shaped UFO.  There were no lights on it and it appeared to be sitting still. The lightning reflected off of it and it only lasted about 2 seconds  but I got a great look at it. When the lightning stopped  it couldn’t be seen. About 12 seconds later  more lightning flashed  but the object was gone. I’ll never forget it. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

619,it was dark and i was staying at my mates house and we were at the front just looking at the sky about 9:00 pm and i noticed a triangle shaped object hovering to the north.  I informed my mate and we just watched it for about half an hour and then out of nowhere we watched it and it started floating west towards us and it vanished pretty weird but DEFINENTLY NOT ANYTHING HUMAN COULD MAKE If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

620,Me and my friend were on the high way me sitting in the passenger seat lookin into the sky.when a purple light appeard zoomed forward n dissapeared in a blink..I thought I was seeing things but the driver saw it and questioned me if I saw it…I can’t think of any other explaination for the sighting I truely believe it was a ufo
621,a friend and I went fishing one night.around 12:30am we saw a huge white object high in the sky.It was above the siris clouds and appeared to be 2/3 the size of the almost full moon.It was traveling very slowly. In the 15 minutes we watched it it went in a straight line  changed from a white color to a light yellowish brown   and moved about 20 degrees in the sky.A very very very  small light came on 3 seconds and then went off this happened 3 times in 15    minutes.It looked like a huge round rock or an astroid. I am out at night a lot either fishing or camping I know what stars planets manmade objects in orbit shooting stars  airplanes and twinking stars are this object looked nothing like any of these things completly different.It had to be at least 8 miles high because it was above the siris clouds.  My guess is that it was 10 to 50 miles high which would mean that it was from 1200 feet to a mile wide.
622,it started right abouve the tree line when i first saw it. then it stated to elevate upwards. when it was high enough  it then stated to move to the left across my house. The object seemed to travel in a triangular direction around my house for hours..it would move up and down by the tree line  the side to side..it was very unusual.it would go to the same spots around my house all night and just sit there for a while.. it was very bright  it threw binoculars looked to be a dimond shape…when it moved it did blink different colors  mostly red or orange. at first i saw just one but 3 more arived and one was sitting right below it for a few minutes  the went seprate ways..
623,Looked like a large fireball  kind of shakey  didn’t hold perfectly still.  Would think it was some kind of blimp  but it took off too fast to consider that as an option.
624,well lets see me and my wife where leaving from her grandmas. we where out side talking saying goodbuy and i noticed a thing that looked like a star but bigger i have seen many in my 34 years so lets just say i look for them all the time.  but back to it it slowly went over us and kinda swaying from side to side my wife said it was a plain but i knew better so i said just keep looking at it and it did just what i thought it would do it faded to nothing right above us and we that see thease know what that means dont we. i will say this out of all the ones i have seen this one was the brightest mostly they have kinda a amber look but never have more than one light.i swere that it knew we saw it If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

625,i was looking out my window when i spotted some peculiar lights flashing they were equally apart i notified my friend who is a strong believer and he suggested it was ufo
626,I saw a egg shaped ufo that was metallic silver about 30 feet off the ground it was about 100ft from me on july 25  2010 it moved towards me going about 5miles an hr it was stationary at first it then slowly moved away over the top of the houses till out of sight it had no sound to it this was in cordova alabama
627,At about 10:30pm on July 21 from our beach front condo in Garden city  S.C. Three of us saw three or four red/orange lights appear in the south east sky over the ocean  forming a straight line in a horizontal position. I thought it was a jet coming into myrtle airport. The lights blinked a little and… as that happened a similar or same set of lights appeared below and to the right of the original ones  then the lights went out / disappeared  (the appearance of the second set of matching lights seemed a little odd) Made for good conversation that evening though. It all happened in about 10 seconds. Wondered if anyone else saw them?
628,hey guys.  i saw them the very next night with my grandparents.  it was right about dusk time and we were walking towards the beach when i looked up and saw a bright red light way out over the ocean.  i immediately said “hey  what’s that?”  the light then faded as another light appeared to the lower left of where the previous light was.   then another light did the same thing upper right from where the first one was.  my grandpa is blind so he didn’t see anything and my grandma said it must’ve been an airplane  but it certainly was no airplane.  the only thing i could possibly think of was maybe they were flares from a military exercise  but it was way up in the sky and the lights followed an unorthodox pattern. the lights disappeared as soon as they came and i looked around the beach to see if anyone else saw them  but of course no one was looking up at the sky.  this was my first ever what i’d call UFO sighting for what it’s worth.  in fact  not long ago i was saying that i had never seen anything strange in the sky before  and then this happened.  i’m just glad i googled it and it looks like numerous people have seen the same thing before. i guess i should report this huh? btw  i was staying at Murrells Inlet.
629,saw three red lights overlooking ocean far in sky then they disappeared slowly then witnessed two in the same area disappear    ive seen airplanes and fireworks and it is not it If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: djpartymasters2008@yahoo.com
630,I saw a UFO last month in Yuma AZ. I cant remember the date but It was quite big with very large green lights. It was heading west at a high speed  then it just vanished.
631,I was lying in bed  and I was looking out my window before I fell asleep. I noticed a very large and bright light up by the roofline. Further in the sky obviously than our roof. I noticed it was moving in a half-circle pattern forwards  then back  then forwards and then back.  I woke my husband to look at the light and as he was leaning over  this light moved slowly over the house. I got up in a hurry to look out our huge picture window in the living room  where I was sure I would see this weird light in the sky if it followed the path it had left on  but there was absolutely nothing in the sky.  There are no neighbors or huge buildings near my home..and there’s a clear shot of the sky all around our property. I have no idea what this could’ve been. There’s no way it was a reflection of anything. I never believed in UFOs…but…I’m seriously creeped out. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

632,1/20/11 My friend and I saw lights over the ocean on 82 blvd in myrtle beach. It was around 7pm  They were red and/or orange.  I dont know if they were flares or what but they went on and off a few times in about 20-30 minutes. sometimes one and sometimes 3-4 at a time.  it would get very bright then dim out in a matter of 10 seconds. anyone see anything ??
633,I thought I was looking at a Cresant moon  and then realized it was to small to be the moon.  It was bright Gold  (like a harvest moon) it slowly faded and disappeared.  I am hoping someone else saw this…not sure it was a UFO  but it was something strange!
634,Soon after the Willow Run airshow ended in July 2009 I witnessed a large bluish white ball shaped object in the night sky. This object was low enough to clearly see that it had some kind of bar running through it with a orb attached to each end.  There were several other orbs following this object as it slowly moved across the sky moving toward Ann Arbor. This object would glow brightly then fade  then glow brightly again. I have some great film footage of this AND several other unknown to man objects. My Eye’s are now always searching the sky. Anyone else see it?

635,we were on lake wylie fishing and it just appeared we watch it for maybe a minute it was moving kinda slow then disappeared.
636,#1 moved steady and fast/no sound or trail. the 2nd one I used binaculars to view as it was staionary. ive never seen one before until last night. For the record i do not drink or use drugs.
637,We were on highway 12 east bound. It looked like it fell from the sky.  It came straight down. It was greenish yellow around  and the middle was blue. From where we were it was about the size of a basketball. We turned back to see if something had crashed or fallen but couldn’t see anything. The thing is that there are no homes or buildings out that way just open fields. Would like to know if anyone else saw anything and what it was. Sarah
638,playing xbox and i hear a noise and i thought it was a plane  and i look out the windo and i see three lights  the front one was red the left was white and the right was orange  the ufo was traveling south and i told my neighbor oad he saw it to.

639,I was in my backyard doing pull ups and after a set I happened to look up into the sky.  I suddenly noticed a round bright object traveling eastbound.  I kept looking at it and was trying to figure out what it was.  It did not appear to be in the shape of an airplane or a helicopter.  I then observed it come to a stop.  It appeared to be hovering in a still position.  It then appeared to start to ascend higher and higher upward until it was out of my sight.  I think that what I just saw was not of this world.  Sorry  I did not take a picture or film this event. But I think I just witnessed a UFO? Perhaps  but it depends who you ask. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

640,large orange light high in the sky. smaller white blinking lights  very high moving all around the sky. large orange light was seen for only a few seconds than just went out. white blinking lights moved all over the sky.  other white lights would blink rapitly around them as they move very fast. we watched this for a long time. in the front yard and the back yard. all over the sky. we live in a very small town. only been here for a few years. you can see the night sky so clearly.  we’ve never seen anything like what we saw that night. but wait  it gets better. they’er still there…we see them all the time. not the big orange light that was so large and like nothing i’ve ever seen  but the blinking lights  with other smaller  faster blinking lights around them  we still see them.  other people see them  nobody really cares  they say it’s just some testing from the military. they think it’s really strange but they just don’t really care. they didn’t see the large orange light that was only there for a few seconds  that i can’t explain to myself  no matter how much research i do  but other people just do not believe there could be anything out there…period.  oh well  i still know what i see with my own eyes. blinking lights don’t stop and move up  then down  then flash across the sky. i’m stiil watching… If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

641,me and my fiance are driving on I49 going south to alexandria  la. it was around 9:30ish. i was driving and he asked me  “hey what is that?!” i looked and it looked to have a flat side with orange lights dimming off and on like a pulse.  it just stayed still for a minute than it rotated. not turned like a plane. just pivoted. and it had a corner like a triangle. and it had the same lights on the other side. a patch of trees covered it for just a split second and it was gone.

642,I was having a smoke on my back door step as i dont smoke in the house and i noticed a light moving across the sky and thought it was a plane until it got closer and realised that it was bright orange and had no aviation lights on it at all  it moved in a northerly direction at low speed so i shouted my girlfriend to come and see it which she did and admits it was a bright orange ball with no flashing lights.  It changed direction to a north westerly heading and picked up speed and altitude over several miles then stopped dead in the air  it hung there for several minutes then vanished behind clouds and was not there when they passed.  I know it sounds bizzarre and it was  its the third strange light I’ve seen since the meteor shower we had a few months ago. Until i saw these things i was unsure of if there may be life out there and now im conviced of it.  i dont care if people dont believe me or think im nuts  i know what ive seen and it freaks me out. it was very bright so im sure someone else must have seen it.
643,I was working at the camp that summer. I was 18 years old. There was another adult leader  and about 20 other campers ranging in age from 11 to 17.  We were at the explorer base on a remote part of the camp on the edge of the lake. We all saw the same thing. It just slowly went across the sky blocking out any stars it went in front of. It was a dark clear night  and all the stars were out.
644,I saw something similar over the skies of Niceville  Fl approximately 9:30 Central on March 12  2010. I was sitting on my balcony and saw two bright globes in the distance.  They were a bright golden color and were hanging in the air  much higher than any flare could be. The lights hovered and went slightly up and down for several minutes. Then they disappeared.
645,Object with flashing red and blue lights hung in the sky for 1.5 hours (that I saw). I thought it was an airplane at first. Then it did not move across the sky so I watched it from about 11:15 until about 12:45 until it slowly moved WSW. It seemed to zig zag a bit while I watched but that could have just been an optical illusion from the rotating/flashing lights.
646,Round orb like object traveled N/W  hovering over cerritos california  object was in my view for roughly three min.  it was orange in color. I was able to record 60 sec. of footage from my cell phone.
647,Large Red Orange light in the sky very high  it did not move and suddenly just disappeared.  I thought it could have been a Helicopter from the local Nat.  Guard but it was way too high for a chopper.  I am sure there is an explanation for this but it was nothing like I have ever seen before.
648,while out the back garden having a cigarette looking at fireworks  just after 12  i noticed orange objects moving across the sky  at first 2. i then called my wife out and we seen 2 more  we then went upstairs adnd could see about 9 over the space of about 10 minutes. they moved in a straight line   south i think then just dissappeared.these were not planes as we live near the airport and know the difference. plus we just discovered that dublin airport was closed at the time.
649,My brother  Kris Whittington  Joan – his girlfriend and two of her girlfriends were in Newcastle Kentucky in a corn field with a camp fire.  They were drinking beer and we were all laying back and staring at the sky.  The sky was full of stars more than I had ever seen in the skies over Kentucky – more like I saw when I lived in the west Colorado  Utah  California etc.   Suddenly the stars were blotted out from the sky – total darknes … like a eclipse of the moon and the stars … very odd and then we saw this …. ship? it was less than 300 yards in the air above the ground .  It slowly  silently   purposely moved over us and past us.  My brother and I began to follow it away from our camp on foot.  We were able to keep it in sight for more than 15 minutes and the only reason we stopped was because the three females with us were crying and very frightened.   They begged us not to follow any longer so we stopped.  The next day the radio said it was a Russian satellite crashing thru the atmosphere …. this craft was not crashing and it was methodical in it’s movements.  There was no fire no rocket exhaust no visible proof of any combustion happening anywhere on the surface of the craft and it made no sound and it was very close to the ground . We had a very good view of the craft for a very long time. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: billyhorsebennington@yahoo.com
650,Nice to see more sightings in Canada.  I live in Sask and in Sept 09 I saw 2 huge white transparent-milky like disks fly over the city.
651,4rth December 2010 Saw the same just one though  above Galway city with 3 others after a dinner party at 20:20 or so  from the Liosbaun estae seemed to come over Tireallan from Bushypark  seemed to rise up slow from behind the hill  going towards Oranmore. My friend captured it on her cameras video mode  poor quality though.  Don’t know what to make of it. My partner saw the same thing before from the balcony but never told me. The friend who captured it on camera told us a guy we both know described witnessing the same event in January over Kinvarra in Co. Galway. Very curious indeed.
652,at around 10 in the evening  i was soaking in my hot tub  when I noticed an object moving in a ballistic fashion towards the east at a high rate of speed  much faster that a commercial airliner  although it appeared to be at a great height. The object crossed two-thirds of the sky then came to a dead stop. It then changed direction 90 degrees to the south  traveled for a second of two and then vanished. I would to hear if anyone else saw it or has an explanation If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: ulyssesmisses@yahoo.com
653,I let my two rottweilers out when I saw red flashing lights. I turned on my porch light and airplanes fly over my house all the time.  It didn’t sound nor look like a plane(believe me  they go over my house twenty times a day  literally). I looked up and saw that it was rounded  red lights going around like carnival game lights. Then  out of no where  another one like it came out.  I got my dogs in as quick as I could  it happened to me at least four times before. My dogs came in as fast as they could for the noise was closer. As they where coming in  I turned off the light and closed the curtains because it was above my house. I locked everything  window  door  vents even.  The vibrating got louder and a burst of light lets it go into space.
654,I  live in Lima  Peru. I am watching Discovery Science Channel right now (March 14th 2010  19:30 hrs)and noticed that they are talking about the strange lights seen over the skies of Kokomo and other places (Texas).  I wish to inform you that my son  his friend and myself saw way up on the sky something that was glowing and sending lights of green  red and white color  similar to the lights of a police car. This happens in a full moon evening in Lima (Northeast direction) at the end of February 2010. It was a clear night and many regular stars could be seen.  Definitively  these lights were not similar to the yellowish or whitish stars (lets say “regular” stars). There were probably two “things”. One relatively closer than the other. Unfortunately  the night became cloudy and lost visibility. Lima sky is usually cloudy. We must wait until the next clear skies (full moon) to see the position where we saw those lights.
655,My husband  Leonardus saw a bright light  also triangular  hanging in the night sky. This was at 3 in the morning. He said that it seemed to change shape and was not a solid triangular shape. It just hovered there for a while then shot off so quickly  he said it could not have been a plane or helicopter. This was on the 3rd January 2011.
656,My husband  son and myself all saw similar lights on Tuesday  April 20th around 9pm from our balcony at the Breakers hotel in Myrtle Beach. We saw 4 orange lights that blinked on and off and then came on all together in a straight line.  The lights disappeared behind a cloud and they did not reappear. About an hour later  my husband and son saw the lights again in a slightly different location again over the ocean  but were unable to get the camera out in time to take a picture.  My sister thought that maybe it was something military as there are a lot of bases in South Carolina but I have NEVER seen anything like this  in my life! Was it a UFO?
657,I captured something with my camera last night over Cambridge  ID. It was a low bright light that appeared to be weaving around. I watched it for 15-20 min. When I was uploading the pictures  I went back a out and it was gone. It looked like it was spinning and pulsating.
658,I was outside smoking like I do every night before bed and I notice this light over a subdivison about a mile or so from my apartment. I was sitting there looking at it and comparing it to other lights in the sky and street lamps for about 2-5 mins while smoking.  before going in I convinced my self it was a helicopter with a spot beam but that still didn’t make sense cause spot beams go all the way to the ground and the lights didn’t go that far in the sky so i got up and leaned on my balcony for a closer look.  As i was looking at it I noticed it had started to move first to the right a little almost unnoticeable and then back then it started moving in my direction and flew just to the left of my building.  I pulled out my phone to get a pic as it was getting closer but thought it was moving to fast to get a belivable pic i leaned over my balcony to get a better look as it was getting closer i heard a sound kinda like an airplane but alot quieter and i got a pretty good glimpse of the shape it was circular with 2 lights coming out of the bottom and flashing lights on the side with a circular like cockpit looking thing coming out the top and it glided across the sky with so much speed and ease.
659,There was a pulsating blue orb in the sky  it was stationary at first  then after a few seconds it made a figure 8 motion like an infinity symbol motion. It stopped for a second and then took off eastward and faded away. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: tonyandcarmela@yahoo.com
660,Sitting in my girlfriends front room when she exclaimed “What the fuck is that in the sky”? Looking up i saw two very bright orange lights moving at a a very quick pace. About 5 minutes later another bright orange light flew in exactly the same direction as the previous two  this time i opened the window to listen but the object did not omit a sound. Very  very strange sighting. This is the 1st time i’ve seen anything like it.
661,AT midnight 09/10 i lay in bed watching tv the fireworks going off in the next road over drew my attention to look towards the window. I notice a small light in the sky thinking it was aircraft  i looked away again.  On looking back seeing a second light behind i thought these planes are to close getting out of bed i could not see any port or starboard lights  from just after midnight until 1 o’clock i and my wife counted over 30 pass from east to west somtimes in twos &threes somtime in fives or more. sky clear full moon
662,Objects have been seen by myself & my husband throughout December 2009  occasionally hovering under venus. Tonight 31/12/2009 we have seen three or four at different times during the evening  flying north to south before silently disappearing to the west possibly circling below venus.
663,i was driving north on the garden state parkwak when all of a sudden this light appears in the sky heading west. It wasn’t blinking like an airplane and was very bright.  almost like a falling star. it appeared in the middle of the sky and i watched it until it got lost behind the trees
664,This is actually happing right now  Im at work I went outside to take a smoke break  I just happend to look up and seen this smoke type cloud thing but it was bright but not to bright.   I didnt think anything of it  but as I stood there for a couple more seconds I noticed all of the red  white and orange-ish lights.  First the red in all different sizes blinking fast then slow blinking white and orange-ish ones.  It kinda of seems like its hovering in the cloud type thing.  It has been there for at least an hour and a half. I tried taking a pic but all I have is my phone and it doesnt do it justice.
665,Me and my friend was just leaving a friends. he pointed up in the sky and said look at that. was a round ship with red lights on the outlining of the ship with a blue light in the middle moving like led lights. i have seen 2 other sightings for my own eyes……this sighting how ever was by far the most closest i have seen one. Everytihng the federation of light is saying is real and is happening. I am just a dj from the southwest uk who other the last year has experienced to many “wierd coincedence’s and sightings to feel that its not true.

666,Dog woke me at 5:45am this morning. As I was getting out of bed I glanced outside and spotted a low flying object moving slowly across the sky.  I opened the window and listened for a sound and to get a clearer image. I heard a low rotating hum and there were 3 prongs or legs hanging down from the object wtih various colors lights all 3 legs.  The lights weren’t flashing lights but stationary. I couldn’t make out the top portion of the object because it was wasn’t completely lighted. The object continue to move southward at a slow rate of speed.  By the time I jumped into my car to follow it. I lost it. The object itself was only about 2 footballs fields away from me. It was exciting. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

667,Saw one light just appear as was looking into night sky at 7:30pm then another light appeared and a second latter another  they moved very slowly to the north – northwest until disappearing over Everglades.There was reports from meterologists about meteor showers this time of year so maybe this accounted for what I saw but I dont no it was Strange. #) minutes latter out of the exact area it reoccurred again and the pattern continued and that was the end of it for the night.

669,1st sighting was a white/red object traveling  fast west to east with a slight orange tail trailing it vanished seconds later.2nd object traveling north to south  first looked like a satilite but was very bright after watching it for about 15 seconds it vanished!the sky was crystal clear no clouds in the area!never reappeared.
670,November 12  2010  1:57am In Vermilion  Ohio was a crystal clear sky. I was looking all over the sky on my buddy’s front porch admiring the stars.  Looking towards Lake Eire(north sky) I witness A round orange pulsating light heading towards me(south east)and thought at first it might of been a plane of some sort  but then realized a plane wouldn’t be pulsating and be a bright orange round shape.  Then it went west for about 15seconds  at a moments notice it traveled north west and it was dimming out and getting smaller and then disappeared. I sat there in disbelief.  I started to look in every direction and could find anything  approximately 10 mins i thought i seen something shoot down off my right eye from the sky going down i could tell what it was but think i t was a shooting star.  then approximatively 7 mins later i seen the orange round pulsating lights again  but this time It was a lil larger came exactly the same direction I got freaked out and ran into my buddy’s house and woke him up and told him i seen strange orange round lights over Lake Eire then told him to come outside he jumped out of bed and come out and the orange round pulsating light was traveling west then went north west and dimmed out and got smaller and disappeared.  We were both kinda weirded out. It was hard for me to sleep. I didn’t want to go outside and do any feather more instigation.
671,I was driving on my way to work and I looked in the sky and seen 3 lights  in a triangular shape. They were bright lights  and then they shot down towards the city of Denver  they stopped  the bottom one shoots South  like a shooting star  i blinked and it was gone.  The other 2  sit there for about 10 seconds  then far to the right  there were 3 little dots (looked like Jets  not passenger airplane) the top one shoots East really fast  like the first one(like a blink of an eye) jet-lookin things come closer  and the last one shoots South  again. There was nothing left  but 3 jets in the sky. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: mikeswife81805@yahoo.com
672,It was 9 pm I was my mother and the girl who rented room on the third floor of my house then we started to see a picture in the sky began to discuss and we realized it was not a plane because a plane is not clear can be static than 2 hours long and was filmed there but then I thought my phone had run out of battery … Well that’s all I’ve seen before such objects but not so characteristic way like that because that redounded color … See you If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

674,Hello  I have recently had an encounter of something I cannot make heads nor tails of why it happened. I live in an affluent area of Leeds  England  where both my separated parents live since 1989 and nothing has happened like it. I suppose it is unusual anywhere let alone where I live! My parents live close together and I often walk from one house to another for some reason or other. I have to pass through a small field behind a primary school to get to each house. One evening at about 11.45pm on Thursday  September 10th  I was walking through the field and saw a large abnormal lump about 15 feet tall and 2 figures moving or shuffling around it in the corner of the field.  There was no lights from what I later find out was a UFO  and since I had my iPod on I was surprised to find that I could hear and feel a low and metallic humming coming from the direction of the UFO. There is no other major lighting to see what was happening except the street lights from the streets nearby but it was still very dark. So I couldn’t make out much of what was happening as I was about 100ft away. I took off my headphones and turned off my iPod  I quickly moved myself to the nearest wall in the hope that the figures did not notice me. By the time I reached the wall I suddenly noticed that a figure that was about 6’3” tall with jet black skin had heading to my direction and was quite close. It surprised and scared me as I swear it had been 100ft away only seconds before and had appeared near me with speed. The first impressions of the alien I had was its dark skin but also its head  it had light coloured eyes that were large  significant and weirdly shaped ears that were folded back and I swear it had some sort of braided hair that looked slightly singed on one side. It spotted me and the alien dragged me about 40-50ft towards the UFO where we met the other alien that was left at the UFO. I was extremely scared by this point and could hardly stand up; I was staring at each alien as they ‘spoke’ to each other. I could not understand a thing they said and I suddenly notice a small light come from the UFO. I could make out that it seemed to be some sort of small shuttle as it was not very large. It had a door  which was open  and seemed like a slightly squashed ball. The green light came from inside the door. As the UFO was seemingly on its side I later assumed they must have crashed. However there were no holes or dirt flown around the area as I might have expected. The only reason I can see is that they were flying just above the ground and not that fast. As I was not putting up any fight and the aliens seemed to talk quite frantically the alien who found me let go of me arm and went to the ground as could not support myself under my panic. Out of this panic I felt the urge to run as fast as I could to the alleyway that was quite nearby. I did not think of how fast the aliens could go I just wanted to run. The aliens must have thought I was not worth chasing and exposing themselves to the local residents as I managed to get to my father’s house without a chase. Since then I have told nobody in fear of ridicule and risking mass panic by the neighbours in the area I live. Please tell me who I should talk to or what to do as do not have any idea of what to do next.
675,Me  my stepdad and his brother walked out side and they saw a very  very bright light in the sky and called me to get my telescope  i got binoculars though. we were looking on as it moved up  down  left  right  and made U-turns  and 360-turns. it is still in the sky now.
676,I was on my way to work and spotted a large reflective metallic object falling from a very high altitude east of Fargo.  I would have thought this was a weather balloon except that it appeared very large and was leaving a white jet trail behind it as it spiraled downward.   This did not look like any jet  military  or research object I have seen before.

678,there ws an orange light in the sky. it looked like someone had turned on a large spot light from the sky.  then many smaller white blinking lights moved away from the orange light and faned out moving fast away from it. the orange light blinked out.  the white lights traveled all over the sky. we watched for about 30 min. then the orange light came back on in the same place it was before. several blinking white came to it from different directions.  the orange light went  so did some of the white lights. some of the blinking white lights moved back out into the sky. they went all over the sky.  we watched several head north west and went to the back yard to see better. there were more already there. north and west. they were very high up and moving very  very fast.  some would go up really high then just stop and stay there for awhile then move down  but at an angle. they were everywhere. we went back to the front. still white blinking lights but not as many.  then we saw and heard two air force jets come in high from the north heading east toward three blinking white lights.  they then turned south  the blinking lights followed them south untill we could no longer see or here the jets. the blinking lights stopped  stayed in placed for a few seconds then one went up and the other two went north  back toward where the orange light had been.  lots of the blinking lights went back  thoughout this whole thing  to where the orange light had been. the orange light never came back on. other air force jet were out in the sky in the back yard (west).  we could tell the difference by the way they look move and did not blink. i have never seen anything like these blinking white lights or the large orange one that never moved  not even in the movies.  the way they moved in the sky  there speed and stopping  staying in one place then move in another direction was not normal.  if this was all air force then they have some really impressive moves they’ve been hiding… If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

679,Myself and two other people I was with saw two bright “star like” lights  and they were following quite close  flying horizontally. They didn’t stray from their straight formation. They were fairly low in the sky  but they definitely were not planes  or satellites.. The lights didn’t flicker or flash  just remained solid white (or yellowish).  They were completely silent and seemed to disappear instantly  not fade out in the distance. Saw them around 6:30pm on 11/26/09 in Lake Havasu City AZ
680,Saw a disc like something not sure while it was in fluorescent yellow color later disappeared later appeared then blinked like a star remained stationary for long time with red and blue color looked similar to star but definitely not a star as it constantly change position in south sky If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

682,When I was a child I saw a silver flying saucer hover over my neighbor’s house in Fall River  MA in August 1978. It was in the paper Fall River Herald News teh next day. Other people in teh area had seen it and one plane almost hit the UFO near Provincetown MA. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

683,On Wednesday (12-29-10)  at around 10:30pm in southern York PA (locally known as Leaders Heights PA) I witnessed a bright orange light moving slowly across the sky.   There was no sound  the light appeared to be comparable in strength to that of a single car light from about 750 feet away  it was steady with no blinking  was around 1-2 miles away  and moved across the sky at a speed and altitude similar to that of a helicopter.   It paused once  moved forward  then eventually stopped.  After about 15 seconds it appeared to move up into the upper atmosphere as the light slowly become smaller and smaller until it wasn’t any brighter than the neighboring stars before disappearing.   A high altitude jet appeared in the same part of the sky seconds before the light began moving into the upper atmosphere.  It took about 10seconds for light to disappear once it started shrinking.  Even though the jet was most likely several miles higher in the sky  I could hear the jet!  What did I see?
684,These were seen by myself & a co-worker. She lives about 30 miles northwest from me. We saw them the same time. They were 2 orange lights in the west sky-slightly north. One was about slightly higher than the other.
685,The first one looked like a plane at first  but the proportions were impossible (it almost formed a triangle)  and there was a series of four large -the most noticeable part of it- spotlights on the bottom.  It looked like it was on fire at first. The second one really did look like a triangle  but the same large spotlights. Both moved very slowly  and then were no longer in sight.  The third one was too far away to determine what shape it was  but it was bright  and moved very quickly. It stopped  not moving  and stayed for several minutes  then I was not able to see it. Two other witnesses were there for all three sightings.
686,This was seen over Weston  FL at 10:17pm on November 14  2009:  Large gray/black triangular object.  It may have a total of 10 orbs within the triangle. The orbs never changed shape or position and had no lights but had a certain glow to it. Crossfield of view was about 8 seconds. The object was totally silent and its path was 5-10 degrees W of N to 5-10 degrees East of S. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

687,I’ve never had an experience like this before. We were on our way to get married! A long weekend with friends and relatives.  Just the two of us were driving an SUV from Portland Airport to Boothbay Harbor Maine  I forget if it was the 15th or 16th of September. It was 2008. It was 12a.m. or later!  We were driving on the highway  nooone else was around. We were talking  singing along with the radio. My now husband was driving the suv. I was looking out the window of the passengers side and above us  to the right—but really above us  I saw: A LARGE— all I can describe it as is “under carriage of a football field” oval shaped ship. It was lit up! I said “holy x!%$%$%$ holy !%$@%@%@%@” several times. I looked for a logical explanation  like…was I just seeing a reflection of the stereo or our belongings in the window….BUT NO! It was really there. My husband kept driving  and the “ship” seemed to go off into the trees  by a field off the highway—but we kept driving and didn’t decide to turn back and investigate! My breath was taken away and to this day I can’t stop thinking about it. Who knows what is was!!?!?!?!?! I keep researching online to see if anyone else reported anything!?
688,I woke up at 4 am because I was not feeling well; turns out I had a bout of food poisoning. But it had just snowed and the sky/clouds were unusually illuminated and that caught my attention. I had gone downstairs to drink some herbal tea to calm my stomach and also noticed my cat continuously looking out the direction of our LR windows.  She was sitting next to me on the coffee table and I noticed her watching something (again) out of the window. I quickly turned around as I was facing opposite our windows in LR when I saw a very fast flash of bright white light  like a laser  go from east to west low in the horizon in front of our home.  After that  came another white light flashing by very quickly but very bright  followed by a red light of the same nature. I called upstairs for my husband to see if he was awake and told him I was seeing some strange lights. I then saw the roof of the neighbors house adjacent to ours light up in a bright circled area. I got up quickly to look as I thought maybe they had woken and turned on some outside lights.  By the time I had walked to the window  the light was gone. By then my husband had gotten up and was looking out of the bedroom windows but saw nothing. I have never seen anything like this before and am wondering if anyone else in the Sedona area may have seen some strange lights on 2/27/11.
689,It was two square shaped objects in the sky sitting there for about 15 min then suddenly vanished.
690,I was about 10 playing in the front yard  across the street was a church  I saw a huge “cigar shaped” object hovering above the church.  I turned around to see if anyone else was looking at it  turned back around  and it was gone.  I’ll never forget it. The next day there were several jets flying very lower over the area.  I have no memory of anypart of my life prior to that experience.  I was a police officer in Nebraska from 1974 to 1996 & have no reason to make this up. thanks
691,they were all in the shape of a triangle  but kept changing position in the sky and they kept flickering then eventually you could see them getting further and further away. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: kimmieg@hotmail.co.uk
692,at about 6:20 pm saw two lines of lights coming up over the treeline.  4 lights in each line with one in the center.   These came up from exactly where airplanes normally come over the treeline when taking off from Detroit airport.  These were not airplanes as they stayed there for over 20 minutes and then just disappeared.   After that ever few minutes three would come up in a diamond formations  would stay still for up to five minutes and then one by on peel off and disappear.   Often one would leave and another would take it’s place.  These were not airplanes as they also stayed in place for up to five minutes.  This went on for over an hour.   Then there was one that would come straight up  linger for a few minutes and then lower while another came up in it’s place.  I watch the airplanes take off from Detroit all the time and these were not airplanes.   At first I thought they were copters and the airport had had a disaster but they did not fly around at all – they just stayed basically in one place – a trapezoid shape with a diamond on top.  Also there were no problems at the airport and no accidents reported that would have commanded that many copters.  It was an amazingly bright display of lights.   I had immediately called my 21 year old son downstairs and when he saw them he said  “Finally – someone else has finally seen them”.   He said that he had seen the lights a few times but by the time my husband or I got around to coming in to look they would be gone.   He had never seen them come up in the straight line formation though – he had seen the trapezoids and triangles after they were there and they only stayed for a couple minutes. Also  there was absolutely no sound and I believe that there were no airplanes taking off or landing while they were there.
693,Three red lights VERY close together. Shaped in a triangle. They did not move  yet one would fade in and out.  Red light would go away and come right back in the exact location. A friend was driving on interstate  she noticed them as well. Said they were triangular with white light in center. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them.

694,I was standing on the sidewalk visiting with a friend about 10 to 11:30  not exactly sure of the hour.  Suddenly  the hair on the back of my neck went up and I looked up and almost directly above us was a large triangular shaped object  flat on the underside.  I remember some white lights  but can’t really say much about how they were situated.  It was right about roof level of my house and directly moving above me  very slowly. The only sound was a low whishing sound. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: hotglasshabit@yahoo.com
695,I was driving home  headed west on I-640 and passing the Knoxville Center Mall exit when I saw something above the trees to the left of the interstate.  I first thought this might be an airplane since it seemed to be in the direction of the airport  but then I realized it was moving.  As I came closer to the object I noticed its triangular shape and as I drove past it was able to see the three white lights and one red light on the bottom. I wish I had pulled off the interstate to take a picture!
696,Was bright light sitting above hilltop that burst straight up in the sky and within 2 seconds was out of sight. If you do contact a witness  please be respectful to them. Contact Email of Witness: deedee61299@hotmail.com
697,i was staying up late i started to see blue lights flashing out of my window and i saw this object with red and green lights travel it soon disappeared in trees i was like what the and i kept staring and another one appeared this one was slightly bigger and it again disappeared into the trees and then another one appeared and this one came towards my house and it got bigger and bigger and i was scared so i got out the window this one was the size of a huge moon then i look out all my windows it was not there
698,Traveling north on I-45 I and a friend saw a neon green sphere shoot across sky with a neon green trail. Object was visible for about 3 seconds and then suddenly disappeared. There was traffic when i was driving from the bike fest so some other people must’ve seen.
699,I was driving home about 9:15  10-29  I saw lights appear in the sky as I was leaving my sister a voicemail and described everything via voicemail to her. One light after another appeared in what seemed like 2-3 second intervals. There was about 5-8 lights  I was trying to watch the road  they came on in intervals  but disappeared all at the same time. My eyes hurt afterwards and had a migraine  I had to leave work early on the 30th because my head hurt still. I drove past the next day and there was nothing there.

700,two orange balls of light- no sound – quite low easy to see with the eye- friends saw them the night before in intake. what are they anyone – see loads of times over doncaster…. seen by a whole group of people and neighbours…
701,It was moving very fast  much faster than a plane. Could be oval or triangle with a glow around it and it disappeared into the clouds.
702,I couldn’t sleep and realized I forgot to take out the garbage. I walked the garbage outside and while walking back to my garage  I saw a large  I mean huge!  triangular object(it was blocking out the stars) on its furthest points there was stobing bright bright blue lights.  Almost white(like xenon headlights) it was very low. The night sky was bright and clear. I was freaked and hurried back to the house. Oh  there was no sound at all. I waited to get the courage up to look again which was about 1 hour later  it was gone. I told my husband and he just looked at me. His eyes spoke as if to say “my wife is crazy”
703,I live in a rural area of Ohio and this is definitely not a common occurrence. I was driving home with my two younger brothers on the night of 10/29/09 and the time was approximately 9:15 pm. or 21:15  Eastern Time  and as I turned onto my street  I looked up in the sky and saw 8 spheres of light.  I slammed on my breaks and just stared at them trying to figure out exactly what it was that I was looking at.  I had never seen anything like it before in my entire life. The lights were white with a yellow tint to them and were in a perfect line with one another.  There were no distortions or imperfections to the spheres at all  only a small halo of light surrounding each one.  They were spaced out evenly and had the appearance of having a curvature formation to them like a saucer or the such.  They also were approximately 17 to 20 times greater in size than the largest star that was near the lights (in the night sky).  The lights were approximately 45 degrees to the horizon in the southeast direction from my position where I was stopped in the road.  I would say that the lights were about half a mile away from where I was.  The lights were near my family’s property and were a ways up in the sky too. Then  just as suddenly as I had seen them  the lights started to go out one by one.  There was a bit of rotation to them as they went out.  I tried to see where they had gone  but there was nothing in the sky.  The only visible objects were a couple of far-off airplanes  the moon  the stars  and clouds.  There were no smoke trails as from a bottle-rocket or other firework product. There was absolutely nothing left after the lights disappeared. I drove around on the back roads for about ten minutes looking for firework trails or an aircraft or anything to explain the situation.  I also kept looking in the same spot where I had seen the lights  but nothing appeared there again.  I finally went home and stood outside for around twenty minutes looking for anything that may be an answer to this phenomenon.  I never saw the lights or anything that even resembled them again.

704,About 9pm  my wife and I were leaving our house. As I walked outside  Out of the corner of my eye  I saw a collection of very bright stars out of the corner of my eye.  As I walked past a tree which obscured my view for a few seconds  my wife commented on seeing something in the eastern sky. I turned and looked to see several very bright ‘stars’ in the sky  in a cluster.  It looked as if it were a constellation. As we continued to look  we noticed they were slowly moving. My wife began counting them  I began to video with my iphone (which show nothing upon viewing).  They were dispursing in a south/southeast direction. My wife counted over thirty. In about a 1.5 to 2 minutes  they slowly faded away. Not uniformly  but each one faded away in it’s own time.  Very strange. Still can’t figure out what it was.

705,I was in my home and could heard a loud vibrating sound and looked out my window expecting to see some sort of vehicle in my private driveway but spotted spinning red and blue lights above the trees about a 1/4 mile out. Continued to watch and the object(still loud vibrating noise) hovered back and forth and slightly up and down before slowly descending and landing in the woods.  Could no longer hear the vibrating sound. It was in the pitch black of night and there are hundreds of acres of woods where it landed.
706,While standing in front of my kitchen window washing dishes I looked out and noticed what appeared to be a bright star.  As I continued to wash the dishes I would look up into the window during one of my looks I noticed what I thought had been a star flash red and white light.  After a period of time the lights appear to dim and then get bright. After 4 minutes of watching this light I noticed it was moving and was able to confirm my the tree lines.  I then ran outside and sure enough it was really moving and really bright. I ran to the door and called for my mother to view and confirm what I was seeing.  The ball of light glided across a field into a backyard of someones house. At this time there was no noise at all and as normal car where passing by and no one stopped or I guess took notice.  After 2 minutes or so we went back in the house and I attempted to continue to wash the remaining dishes when I looked up again and this bright light reappear directly in front of the open field and went out.  I never saw it again. My house sits in front of a open field and across the open field is a tree line that is part of a subdivision (The Country Estates  I think).  I am wondering if anyone else saw this as well or maybe if the light moving was visible from highway 70?
707,started off as 7 circular reddish lights in sky.. no sound  no flashing  too far away to determine exactly what they were  close enough to know it wasn’t helicopters  planes  weather balloons  hot air balloons etc.. disappearing one by one.. total sighting time  about 2 minutes…moving slowly the entire time 
708,I do not know why I am motivated to report this after many years. Some years back. I am positive it was 2003  I saw a triangle UFO flying low when I got off work at around 9pm. I followed it and funny thing is it moved right over my apartment.  I lived in a 3 story building and it was maybe 10 feet or so higher. It was moving slow  had lights going down each side on the underside to where the lights formed a “V” pattern. It was low enough that I can see the light of the lights reflecting off the metal of the craft.  Funny thing about the whole experience is that it made no detectable sound despite it being so low in the sky. I got out of my car as i watched it slowly move behind my building and out of sight.  It was flying way too low to be an aircraft. i was able to see the direct metal of the ship it was that low. I was not scared. I had quite a few sightings in my lifetime  my mother actually claims to be an abductee  but this story sticks out the most.
709,hello my name is chelsea and I didnt beleave in other known living beings out there. One lonly night I was in the living room near the big window and i looked up at the moon and saw it just siting in the way of the full moon view.After about 20 sec. it was gone and flew rigth back again with like 4 others following it. There where no ligths or anything the only way I could tell it was there was from the moon light. AND I LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE!!!!!!!!!!??????????
710,At approx. 5:30 AM I was getting newspaper from driveway I looked up and saw a triangle of 3 red dots with a fourth dot in the lead heading what appeared to be slow ENE. I watched till they vanished from site. I hope others may have seen this sighting.
711,I was waiting outside for my associates to finish eating. I was listening to my iPod and something told me to look up to my right in the sky. Judging what Ive seen on tv I did wanna tell anyone or tell someone to “look at that” because I didn’t quite know what it was. It NEVER pulsated. Must’ve traveled for 3 and a half minutes.  Once it got on the line I was standing on it slowed down. Then it went back to the same speed it was first traveling. There was a huge gap between trees. When it passed through that gap it began to shrink rapidly and it was a sufficient size. THATS when I knew I was looking at a UFO.
712,THERE WERE FLYING ALL TOGHETER IN LINE  ABOUT 10 (HAD TO RUN TO GET MY CAMERA) THEN FEW MINUTES LATER 1 MORE…. AND THEN ANOTHER ONE…. I VIDEO TAPE IT THEY LOOK LIKE MOVING ERRADICALY…LOTS OF LIGHT
713,it was making a large humming sound waw waw waw ya i know sound funny was moving rather slowly to be plane but maybe some kind of new science ?could feel it before you heard it..
714,Objects were hovering  one disappeared  one moved away from the other in a upward motion  hovered then disappeared. The remaining hovered for a few more minutes then vanished.
715,very quiet  6 lights in body compartment went flashing twice  then total darkness  flash light did not have any effect on lighting up  beam on ground all around us  we were all waving and yelling to it  just hovered there beaming light on the ground  never on us. Mothered gathered us all up and ran back into woods and path back to house  all were shaken  parents explained it away as maybe a hot air balloon? I was only 10 yrs old.
716,This was 30 – 45 min after the WEBN fire works.  The object was less than 200 feet above the house and was moving a twice the speed of a fast walk. 3 peachy lights one at each triangle point. Notice it because the lights were moving a little faster than I was walking and I could see right through it. It was Low..later on tv they had a report of unknown lights taking off out of MAinstrase Area. Bet they come back this year in 3 weeks. After all WEBN does put on a great show.
717,It flew over my head and hovered 2 miles in front of my car when I took the picture
718,I was driving on south on Route 6 when I noticed a slow moving silver object in the sky.  I got out of my car to watch it  and two people stopped behind me to look at it.   Suddenly 5 small objects came out of multiple directions at very high speed.  The small objects followed the large one for about 90 seconds  and then took off at extremely high speed in multiple directions.  The large object then continued at low speed until it disappeared over the horizon.   When I got home My wife told me excitedly about her sighting of the same UFO.  She was a mile ahead of me on the highway.  I did not report it because I had a Top Secret Security clearance and did not want to jeopardize it.
